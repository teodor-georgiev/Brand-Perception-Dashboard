This section of the dashboard utilizes data from the research paper titled "Mining Brand Perceptions from Twitter Social Networks" authored by Aron Culotta and Jennifer Cutler in 2016. The purpose is to visually compare brand perceptions extracted from Twitter with survey data. The primary component of this section is a scatter plot that presents the chosen scores. Directly below it, two box plots depict the distribution of specific scores for each selected sector. The dashboard's displayed data can be managed using three drop-down menus. The first two menus allow users to choose the perceptual attribute and score type (Social Perception Score or Survey) to be shown on the X or Y-axis. The third menu allow for the selection of multiple values and filters the industry sectors displayed on the dashboard.
