Profitable and debt-free tea maker DAVIDsTEA (DTEA) has a big variety of specialty teas including many organic specialty teas, facts here:davidstea.com/ca_en/organic...

Van Ettinger said the tea market has been changing with consumers of all ages looking for beverages to suit different needs.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening is that people don‚Äôt look at tea as one drink now in one moment. They are discovering tea as a magical product that does different things at different times of day,‚Äù he said.

Nothing interesting right? How about if I tell you that Starbucks also sells coffee pods called K-Cup pods and they‚Äôre not recyclable. Do you think that a company that made such a huge move from selling plastic cups/straws/lids to fully recycled products will not also change their pods to recycled ones? Think again. 

Keep in mind that NEXE is the only company in the whole world that produces fully recyclable pods. Yes you heard it right, in the WHOLE WORLD. 

NEXE is a stock that you buy and forget about. Just keep loading and you‚Äôll be thankful later. This is a disruptive product that will be the new norm.

Gorilla Glue IPO'S @ $112.83, & within a day, protest on all sides begin. Within a week the terms ''sniffing glue'' & ''sticking it to the man'' is considered racist.  Meanwhile, the name Elmer is lost to history.

Days after the impeachment trials end, a protester with a Maga hat gorrilla glued to his head dumps a bucket of water on Nancy Pelosi, who proceeds to melt away while all the old white guys near her turn into flying monkeys & take to the sky.

2/5/21, 06:10 PM;Bullish;0;1;"$QCOM (Part 1)  I will tell you all a very interesting story which is not so old. People hate old references.

I believe $SBUX  is a great investment due for 2021 and I‚Äôve done my homework on this one. I was so sure that they‚Äôll beat estimates that I loaded my portfolio with the stock prior to earning because I thought it‚Äôll fly. Pathetic idea. They were short and went down. 
But analyst raised their expectation and said it was still a remarkable achievement. It went as low as late 95s a week ago.
Now it‚Äôs back to 107 (my buy price 104.5). I didn‚Äôt make a thousand bucks in loss because I knew it‚Äôll go up. 

About qualcom, they are expected to rise to $175-180 within the next 12 months. We all know that never happens and stock rallies to the 12 month forecast price before it actually gets there. The forecasts are promising. The sales are respectable.
They are the biggest chip makers in usa and nothing will deny that. They have a piece of everything. 

I say buy! I say hold!"

 If there was ever a doubt about manipulation exists:

Robinhood and other Brokerages send your order to Market Maker (e.g. Citadel). -> Market Maker can ALTER the order flow of your transaction -> they use the data on your and other orders to MODEL the market sentiment and movements -> They use these models to their advantage and our detriment (e.g. shorting)

CONSIDER DROPPING ROBINHOOD -  and any other brokerage that routs your order through a MM. They do not allow for real price discovery, meaning you're not able to interact with the REAL market through RH. The vast amount of orders in the marketplace never meet each other because of Robinhood/other brokerages routing it to MMs beforehand."
1/30/21, 12:20 AM;Bearish;3;13;"$IPOE looking at the Robinhood block list it basically bans popular stocks.  Of course $GME and $AMC but also some momentum pharma plays like $JAGX not even tied to squeezes - banned.  Even $SBUX was on there!

Get yourself a broker that doesn't have the worst trading UI out there, tight limits on trading hours, no support for instruments like warrants, and a now a ban on popular stocks. 

Other houses have ""free"" trades and don't make you put up with all this. It was bad before the Judas turn.  Now it's the worst brokerage option out there."

THINGS THAT MAY HAPPEN THIS WEEK

Despite heavy security, President Biden is kidnapped at his own inauguration by an organization called T.R.U.M.P.  which stands for Tell Republicans U Must Pay.  The fact that the group consist of several dozen confused drunken Democrats is why they don't get more than 2 blocks before they are captured inside a $SBUX arguing who's going to pay for all the coffee, gas & tolls. 

$LKNCY  SP soars to $112.83 after the Chinese discover they like their coffee served in cups with a grown up Bambi printed on them more than a cup with a Statue of Liberty mermaid hybrid on them.

The country of Namibia declares war on France for no reason whatsoever.  The war ends w/o a shot being fired after Namibia's only war canoe loses a paddle.

12/29/20, 05:52 AM;Bullish;12;30;"$LKNCY $SBUX

At a market cap of 120B, each of SBUX's 30K stores are valued at 4M.

If LKNCY's 5K stores are valued at:
1) 4M a piece, expect a market cap of 20B
2) 2M a piece, expect a market cap of 10B
3) 1M a piece, expect a market cap of 5B

Today LKNCY's market cap is ~1.5B... let that sink in for a moment.

Extra:

1) Entire board replaced (something NKLA should have done)
2) New board REPAYING debts of the old board to shareholders
3) Situation with SEC cleared up
4) Store revenue up from 2019
5) 60% of stores are now profitable
6) China's economy bouncing back faster than any other on earth from the ""new flu""

imo, as a speculator, I expect this to be trading at ~20 in the next 6 months."

For me Luckin Coffee has become even more bullish when it comes to which company can multiply it's current share price by ten within 1year. And herefore I have seleceted Luckin Coffee already months ago and now I am reassured with that selection!

I have already done the mistake with $NIO that I have sold to early but this time I will stay patient because now there is no need to sell even if the share price will jump 30%-70% today. I am expecting from now on time by time new announcements from Luckin which will show that they have a great business to get the world market leader in coffee sales and beyond.

Lately, I've become more health conscious and have been drinking only organic coffee for a few months now, but one day recently, when I didn't have time to make coffee at home, I went through a Starbucks drive thru to pick up the trusty old Venti Pike Place.  For some reason, that stuff gave me the worst headache.  I wish Starbucks would switch to all organic beans -- I think the pesticides and herbicides (e.g., glyphosate / Round Up) are really bad for people long term, even if they were not the culprits of my headache that day.

Modern Meat Launches Vancouver Island Expansion Plan with Key Accounts and TV Marketing Campaign. 
They are starting a TV Marketing Campaign. I am excited how it will look like for a $42MIO worth company. Great!
newswire.ca/news-releases/m...
$LKNCY (market cap $1.2bio)
Were founded to get $SBUX first competitor. With >4000 stores in China and compared to the market cap of $115BIO of Starbuck it seems that Luckin Coffee is very undervalued. But investors are currently waiting for the ER of Luckin Coffee to prove if they are undervalued or not. 
I am invested because if they would't have money on bank then they also wouldn't open new stores, develop and extend their great productportfolio, change the management, etc. 

EV stocks will now be a play for me because they jumped to fast like $XPEV, $LI but also they have great products.

Stay save."

For those of you wanting to enter & exit at the best price, wait for the next dip, pump & dump, etc., let me share a personal story. 

Back in '92, had a big load of $$$ (to me at the time - high 5 figures) & about to park into $SBUX which had just gone public. 

My brother-in-law's company had managed all of their financials during their infancy & beyond when they were one store. Contacted him about pulling the trigger & reply was that price was a bit high & wait for pullback (talking less than a $1 here) Stock was trading in low 28's . 

Within a day or two, there was a featured article in USA Today  (actual newspaper we held) on them. Stock then rocketed  up to $48+ ... This publication had a big influence at the time on stock movement for the retail investor as internet was yet to be a factor. 

Remember that day well. Details clear on the weather, hotel, location, where I read the piece, etc.  

LESSON HERE???"

That is great! When we are comparing the load factor of the stores Luckin Coffee based on their small store but with a lot of people is clearly more loaded than Starbucks. But therefore I agree that $SBUX has the nicer store. 

But for me I would definitely decide for Luckin Coffee since they have the same tasty products like Starbucks but a way cheaper. 

Based on that videos I am getting bullisher day by day! Now Luckin management try to just release an announcement regarding how Luckin Coffee is doing and all investors of Luckin Coffee would very appreciate that.

11/17/20, 03:12 PM;Bullish;2;1;$SBUX SBUX- has been a sleeper play since the last huge chart play. Finding temporary support near the 95-95.20 range. Looking to test that $100 psychological barrier and may reject it the first time or blow pass it to 101-102 possibly. I would give this 1-2 weeks to consolidate for that push to $100. If you are looking to play this week a spread call is the best to fight against theta as this could trade around 95-100 this week. Thus, if you are buying a long call I suggest 1-2 weeks out. However, if you are playing for the potential play upward for this week then a spread.

11/6/20, 04:42 PM;Bullish;3;7;"$LKNCY Lets break down $SBUX China as a percentage of revenue and then see where Luckin Coffee would have to trade to equal that valuation. 

SBUX China: 4706 stores bring in $814.5m at a 105.9B market cap.
SBUX China = 13.13% of total SBUX revenue
13.13% of 105.9B = 13.90B market cap for SBUX China 

So, to equal this market cap Luckin Coffee would have to increase in size 11.58x, or trade at $59.64. 

Assumption: Luckin by now also has 4706 locations.
Caveat: SBUX valuation is boosted by share buybacks and the 2% dividend yield. SBUX shares most likely have better margins due to higher ticket sales and more food offerings. SBUX benefits from the economy of scale as the risk is spread around the world and its 32,000 locations."

SBUX- starbucks still expanding its stores and seeking more revenue per year. I like the chart as it is near the trendline support of the ascending wedge and there  is support at the sma 50. As the market recovers, I can see starbucks breaking past 90 to 93. However, under 85 I wouldn‚Äôt touch the play just incase of the downward pattern formulating. If I would play this I would hedge puts on the weekly and open up a long play for myself. 

WMT- a lot of support around 140$ and it is possibly a good level to play at. If I was going long on Walmart I would be closer in the money at least 140-145 for long play and hedge puts on the weekly just incase the market tanks. Im quite surprised that Walmart didn‚Äôt sell off as much.

Digital sales surged by 202% yr/yr to $776 mln, accounting for 49% of total sales. CMG says it could exceed $2.5 bln in digital sales this year, more than double last year's amount.
About half of CMG's digital sales are coming from the delivery channel, which is benefiting from expanded food delivery partnerships.
The company says it's currently testing delivery price increases.
CMG has retained 80-85% of digital sales since the COVID-related trough this spring. The company continues to invest in making its digital experience as convenient and easy as possible.
The digital mix remains in the high 40s so far in October.
August was the high point for comparable sales during the quarter, but comps reached mid-single digit growth in mid-September. That trend has continued into October."

Subscription models are now becoming increasingly popular among coffee purveyors.

And it is right that we do not know then the ER is coming but we do know that LKNCY is one of the largest coffee resale companies in the world directly behind $SBUX. Currently LKNCY has the bigger product protfolio then Starbuck and has a more innovative business model. Therefore we know that the share price should be at least at $20.  Just compare to the picture underneath. But don't forget you have always multiply Starbucks share price by 4. So for example if you think that LKNCY will also reach some day the hights of Starbuck then it would not be $100 as for Starbucks it would be $400 for LKNCY becuase Starbucks has four times more shares available then LKNCY."

10/11/20, 03:02 AM;Bullish;5;2;"$SBUX $SPY Trade Idea

From April - August of this year SBUX was trading in a range between 72-79.  When a range is trading like that for an extended time the break of the channel usually leads to an extended move.  As you can see by looking at the blue arrow in the screen shot the break of 79 lead to a very quick run to 87.  Now that resistance at 87 has been broken it is likely that we see a run into the mid 90's.  

Target? $93.50

A Sept. 14 report from the National Restaurant Association projects that at least 100,000 restaurants will close in 2020.

Morningstar; We believe 2020 will be the first of multiple years of restaurant closures, with as much as 15% of restaurants in the US presently at risk for permanent closure. Full-service restaurant chains are the obvious category at risk, but we also expect closures among smaller specialty coffee chains (chains under five units) and urban-focused fast-casual chains.

Restaurants Canada: An est'd 40% of independent restaurants are at risk of closing by March 2021. And roughly 10% of establishments closed for good during the first six months of the pandemic.

10/6/20, 12:31 PM;Bullish;3;7;"$LKNCY who wouldn't wish to hold 2008 starbucks stock for $4.03 per share. Now Starbucks stands at around $100 a share. In my opinion, the same will be the case with Luckin Coffee in a couple of years. Today we're talking about $1- $5 gains, but in a few years we're talking about $50 dollar gains. I hope I can stay strong and not sell Luckin Coffee for $30. I would have liked the same for Starbucks, but I don't make that mistake a second time, because it is obvious that Luckin will see these prices too. Luckins business is working incredible good!

SAIL ‚Äì This has shipped into a possible run to 50$ gap play. Broken the ascending wedge and part of the tech sector. If tech increases I can see this being another parabolic jump to test $50. In addition, it was upgraded to 50 pt not long ago. This could consolidate around 45 or even break down the wedge so that is a possibility when you see these wedge plays. However, high risk vs reward if you play the 50 strike calls. 

SBUX- really strong support near 85 and 86 level. Still looking for starbucks to make that bullish move above 90 but first it must go to 88 and see an uptrend towards that. Safe bet that this can go to 88-90 end of the week. Long term it is a good play and can see 100 in a few months. If you are looking to play this week debit/bull put spread around 85/86 to 88 as the safest bets."

NVDA- still a strong bullish movement could hit a new all time high and even break to 620. Was a chart play call in the discord from last week at 480$ huge gainer here. 

PEP- good earnings and possibly fill the gap for a long-term position near the 143-147 range. Have to consolidate and burn the options for a little bit in the morning but has strong support. A good long-term play 

PINS- looks good for a potential gap up to 43-44. Could drop around low 41s for an entry but I see upward continuation for the short term. 
PYPL ‚Äì Looking to breakout pass the 200 mark and test the gap fill to 205-208 mark first. Watch out for paypal to explode this week or next. This was a call from yesterday from 193 range. Possible dip play around 195-196 maybe. 
SBUX- nice chart set up around the sma. Could test the 88-90$ soon actually. Can be a good short term swing. Anything below 85 I wouldn‚Äôt swing calls honestly."

Starbucks broke out of its range in the 72-79 area (where it spent 4 months consolidating) two weeks ago. After the break it went on a 12% run in 7 trading days which is extremely bullish.  At the moment SBUX looks too be struggling at 87 which is a resistance area.  I am looking for a pull back to the 1D 21 (yellow line) where i expect some big buying. Pull back area is likely the 83-84 area.  1D momentum oscillator's are high in the range and crossing down which is bearish. 

Short term: Bearish (next 1 - 4 Weeks)
Long Term: Bullish

9/4/20, 04:10 AM;Bullish;0;1;"$SBUX $SPY Trade Idea

Starbucks has been one of my favorite stocks to trade this week.  After consolidating in the 72-79 range for 4 months last week sbux broke out.  Its run ended today with a gap fill that was created in march of this year.  Overall if sbux is able to hold 86 i think more upside is likely, though if 86 breaks sbux could revisit the 82-83 area.  1D momentum oscillator's are looking tired which may indicate more downside. 

Follow me for stock discussion and analysis."
9/4/20, 03:54 AM;Bullish;5;1;"$DOCU 

Here is my prognosis. 

So folks are worried about higher evaluations on tech sector but interestingly enough thats the sector that grows more exponentially then most of the value companies . For example you had $SBUX lowered their future guidance and everyone love their coffee. 

Second of all , in regards to Docu , the stock found its AM bottom at the price at which it was at pre earnings run up. They beat the earnings so its hard to imagine that this will not get reflected in the stock price . 

Lastly , $CRM dumped $ZM after it has given them quad return , Docu is up for them the same amount so why are they keeping it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Got to the 1k milestone I would like to thank everyone who joines my stocktwits room as well. I will always answer each person and will continue to do so. Even when that I had only 10 people in the beginning of the month. I decide to take this more seriously to help the average person. I don't want anyone to be a  number and I want them to succeed. My discord and website will come soon

I will be doing personal 1v1 mentoring and teaching you to be successful. I will teach you the fundamentals of trading options and taking profit. I will even analyze your personal plays. I'm only one person, so I can't schedule everyone a 1v1 mentorship immediately. If these gurus can do well in the market you can too. There's no special talent it just takes power and wisdom. Remember profit is profit 10 percent or 100 it is more than you started with üî•

If you haven't followed you can join the team and make 10-300 percent + weekly. Like this if you want to grow and learn"

Starbucks is forming a base of support needed for the next leg up or possible breakdown to the $81. With a solid push it can see an AMD type move fill a potential gap bear 87-91$ range. Made a call to buy this yesterday. 

Buy on the dip. October 16, $90 strike , target buy $1.40-$1.58 

Target $87-91 today or in a week. Weekly swing . If there is a failure to break stop loss at $83 or $1.10-$1.18 

MRVL - an old alert that people made bank. Look close for an entry. Almost a 52 break high. $40 is a target. Not sure if I'll enter.

FCX- idea buy for this was yesterday. Alerted this 10 times in three days. People who bought the first time are up at least 50 percent. Second alert people be up 30 percent. New people should be up just a little.

Dip ideal : October 16, $17 strike, .63-.71 , save capital if it has to pull back to $14.80-$15.20 range. If it pull back save capital for a dip opportunity of .45-.55 range.

 Good morning üôè I'll be posting my watchlist and picks tonight and monitor market opening for an entrance. Remember never go all in and play small. Don't play weekly calls unless you are day trading. Remember if you are up always take profit and dont think about what of , could of , should of. If you are down a bit remember you still have time before the expiration and don't panic. If you play small then your losses can be minimal and always diversify. No need to put your money in one basket. Sure you can win big in the short time but you can't always win like that. Small gains accumulate to wealth. 

Follow me if you want my alerts and reasoning for each stock. Always do your research and everything I do is based on technical charting and fundamental drivers in my scanner. Remember I'm not going to be 100 percent accurate but will try my best to position you into some gains whether it is 10 percent or 300 percent. I do this on my free time to help."

8/26/20, 06:29 PM;;3;5;"$LKNCY $SBUX I think the reason Starbucks is so successful is the number of locations you can find one anywhere and other coffee shops can't compete because there's already a Starbucks on every corner. to open coffee shops beside an established brand is suicidal until Luckin.

With the money it raised, Luckin stores have surrounded Starbucks stores in China cutting off their sales. with the right brand awareness, customers realize they can get a good cup of coffee closer to where they are they don't have to walk another block to go to Starbucks

In the rest of the world, Starbucks uses the number of their locations as a weapon against other chains but in China, there are more Luckin shops than Starbucks, and if we keep expanding we wipe out one of the competitor's greatest advantages and turn it into our own!"

  New to the stock game trying to understand some things so go easy on me here..

Luckin Coffee has over 4000 stores in china in a short period of time. They were killing it then got into trouble forging numbers. Now there stock is ridiculously low especially if you compare the 2 dollar stock price to Starbucks' 77 dollar stock. I know they aren't as big as Starbucks but they do have more stores in china than Starbucks in the very shot time they have been around.

While the bad events happpend to Luckin they still have 4000 open shops through covid, they are still popular. People aren't going to change there coffee brand over this scandle, especially where the Chinese love to support there own.

With this at such a low price why isn't this a ""must buy""?

Overall, Uber says Canadians order Caramel Macchiatos the most, with Albertans & British Columbians preferring it hot, and Manitobans, Nova Scotians, Ontarians & Saskatchewanians liking it cold. 

Meanwhile, the Birthday Cake Pop is the most popular food item in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, & Ontario. 

Canadians on the East & West coasts, on the other hand, most often order the Double Smoked Bacon, Cheddar & Egg sandwich. 

Another random ordering tidbit was the fact that one person in Toronto ordered a record 342 times from Starbucks in the year since the coffee chain launched in Uber Eats."

Starbucks breaking above the range it has been in for the last 4 months.  The last break upwards quickly lead to $83.  1D momentum oscillator's are bullishly postured which leads me to believe further upside is likely.  My target here is the 81-83 area.  Though if price action breaks back below 78.50 that will negate my analysis.

Starbucks has been in the 72-79 range since April of this year.  Price action has made 7 full range bounces in this time.  These last few trading sessions price action has been holding on close to the top of the range at 79.  A break upwards will likely lead to a huge pump in price action. A reject and close below the 1D 200 (purple line) will likely lead to the bottom of the range $72.

Starbucks has been in the same 71 - 79 channel since april.  When a stock consolidates in a channel for so long it usually means that the break one way or the other will be explosive.  With the 1D momentum oscillators in a bearish posture it looks like this will revisit the 71-72 area.

Does this mean that we dismiss such technical analysis out-of-hand? I would hope not! What it really comes down to is recognizing that in real-time, such breadth measures aren‚Äôt terribly useful and shouldn‚Äôt be feared when displaying divergences. As an active investor/trader, what‚Äôs most relevant is knowing how to ACT when stocks do retreat. No breadth indicator will send you a personalized e-mail alerting you to how much the market will retreat, 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%? There‚Äôs no real way to know from weakening breadth and divergence from up-trending price action when or how much the market will eventually consolidate or how long it will prove to consolidate. 
 
The market pundits will try every trick in the book to plague investors/traders with bearish divergence narratives. I simply ask investors/traders to have a game plan, remain open-minded and be flexible to a wide variety of outcomes."

Starbucks still in the 71-79 channel it has been in since early april.  If I would have just bought the bottom of the channel and sold the top I would have made a fortune already.  I am waiting to see which side breaks first.  With RSI and Stochastic's in a bearish posture and heading down it looks like this may revisit the bottom of the channel.

- No stores had drive-thrus pre-covid creating extra costs by trying to add drive thrus on the few they can, add delivery drivers 
- sales still down 90% YOY despite the increase in online orders 
- Q2 Earnings Report did not account for the fact that they did NOT pay rent and booked stimulus money as revenue 
- Provided no Forward looking guidance in recent ER (because it‚Äôs terrible)
- they make money by selling burritos, yet currently trading like a tech stock ‚Äì COMPARE the one year chart to any other restaurant, food & bev stock (i.e. $MCD , $SHAK , $SBUX , $RRGB and the lists goes on - all way cheaper than CMG and ALL of their charts reflect the hit these companies are taking from the covid times that are here indefinitely).

7/29/20, 04:28 AM;Bullish;0;0;$SBUX Starbucks (SBUX) after the closing bell on Tuesday reported better-than-expected results with its fiscal third quarter 2020 earnings. Total net revenues of $4.2 billion (-38% YoY) slightly edged the $4.06 billion consensus, and adjusted loss per share of 46 cents was a better result against expectations of a $0.59 loss.

7/29/20, 12:54 AM;Bullish;0;2;$SBUX  Bears are very upset right now and want to get people nervous. The fact of the matter is the overall losses they‚Äôve suffered is baked into the price already. They are weathering the storm much better than most in the food/beverage industry. This will touch $83-$84 tomorrow, but more importantly $130-$140 a year from today.

This week, the fund flow of the stock market totally reversed back to Bearish where 4 of my Tide Indicators are short on the stock market again. This will reverse the indication last week that the fund flow of the stock market might be switching back to Bullish soon. The Tide Indicators for this week will imply that the fund flow of the stock market still remains Bearish and there is surely no reversal back to Bullish fund flow yet.

Similarly, looking on the price action of the major charts, the price action is also starting to become bearish again. I am now expecting the Bearish tide to resume again in the upcoming weeks with these double top forming in the charts. With all these indications, I will be still maintaining my Bearish tide portfolio.

I will share more in my Full Tide Indicators analysis on 27 July. Cheers üòä"

7/26/20, 06:09 AM;;0;0;$SBUX Working from home I find myself drinking far less coffee because I get more sleep.  Offices also are buying far less Seattle's Best and Starbucks for their breakrooms.  Starbucks located in airports, hotels and malls hurting.  Less tourists in big cities like NYC, Paris, Tokyo has to affect sales.  Not being able to go inside and chill while using WiFi means less sales.  But people see long lines at drive thrus and think this company benefits from covid even after they explicitly said it hurts them.   That I don't get.

KEY POINTS 
The move is an escalation of political tensions between the world‚Äôs two largest economies. 
State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the directive to close China‚Äôs consulate general in Houston was made to protect American intellectual property and the private information of its citizens. 
China condemned the decision, warning of firm countermeasures if the U.S. fails to urgently rescind the order."

Starbucks looking to bounce to the top of the channel it has been in since April.  The channel is from 71 - 79 and SBUX has ranged many times in the last few months.   I am looking to see how SBUX responds at the top of the range when it comes into contact with the 1D 200.  A break this time could lead to a very big trade.

Starbucks heading back up to the top of the channel (71-79).  I am waiting to see how Starbucks reacts when it gets to the 78-79 area which represents the top trend line and 1D 200 (purple line).  This should be a good setup for a trade either way.  A reject and sbux probably heads back down to 71 or a break and sbux probably heads back towards ATH's.

Starbucks still sitting in the 71 -  79 channel.  I am not going to trade this until is breaks one way or the other.  I think a break of either side will lead to a big trade either way so it is important to watch this channel.  Typically the longer a stock sits in the channel the bigger the break will be.

$TSLA After a record run, they are forced into a 50-1 R/S when it's discovered that Covid can be transmitted thru electricity, plummeting the SP under .30.

$NTEC  Even 2 recent offering & a proposed R/S couldn't stop this going up over 20%, so they team up with $BYND  to create the worst tasting undigestable pill in the history of mankind. Days later CEO Meckler almost chokes to death eating a kosher meatless burger. SP soars to $112.83

Doing so would reduce share price volatility, and forces competing buyers to bid higher for shares after positive news events. 

In addition, it may also help drive a cultural change within the business.

Today we can see the 1D 21 (yellow line) rejected price action heavy which leads me to believe this will be heading back down to the $72 area.

Starbucks finding support on the 71.70. horizontal last week and now breaking through the 1D 21.  With Stochastic's and RSI crossing up into a bullish posture I could see this making its way back up to $78 quickly.  

Overall I am waiting to see if 71 or 79 breaks first as $SBUX has been in this channel for about 3 months.  A break of either side will lead to a great move.

I will ask again...What is the probability (0-100%) that Starbucks will have to cut its dividend? 
 
Note: Starbucks has already stopped their stock buyback program, they are bleeding cash, and they do not have much cash left.  
  
The probability of Starbucks cutting its dividend is 95% (maybe higher). 
 
Remember, Starbucks' recent 10-Q included NEW dividend language, which suggested a cut in its dividend payment. The new sentence is:  
  
""As of the date of this report, we do not expect to reduce our quarterly dividend as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.""  
  
This gives Starbucks sufficient cover to say, after the date of the report, they changed their minds because they need to preserve their cash balances due to the extended closures of their stores, customers are not returning as quickly as they thought and landlords will not reduce their rent."

DEAD.  This store used to have a line.  Every store in the city looks the same.  These stores reopened ~4 weeks ago and still nobody.  Q2 and Q3 gonna be bad.

With all these bearish price action and as forewarned from my Tide Indicators that a market peak will be approaching the stock market, I am now Bearish instead of Neutral on the stock market.

The Bearish tide has finally arrived and I had closed the remaining of my Long positions according to my trading plan. You may also find my planned Bearish tide portfolio in my blog. 

With this market peak arriving, it had again summed up another trading cycle of mine from End-March 2020 to Mid-June 2020. It has been a massive ride up following the massive ride down previously.

Remember, that's what the lockdown was about in the first place - getting it under control until we had the resources to more effectively deal with it. There won't be another nationwide lockdown. More testing = more positive cases. Right now we are testing more than ever, but % positive is as low as it has ever been. As long as that stays under 10%, we'll be fine.

This week, we can see that Bearish price action are being revealed one by one in the stock market. Even though I couldn't get a bearish confirmation on Friday trading and still remain Neutral on stock market, overall the bearish tide seems to be taking over pretty soon. 

Furthermore, as per the Tide Indicators for today (13 June 2020), we can see the fund flow on JPY had finally reversed to Short on the stock market. This further confirmed to me that a market peak/reversal is imminent. The price action on monday trading or next week will be important for myself regarding my remaining Long positions and trading plan.

In 2008 I held $SBUX @26.00-- it tanked to $4.65. literally overnight. Naturally, I was a fucked bag holder..I licked my wounds, and had no choice other than to ride it out. As the smoke cleared, it became a steady horse-not a sprinter-just steady. In 2015, it SPLIT 2 for 1 at $83.00. Now, throughout all the chaos recently, it currently sits at $84.00-(It was $56.00 March 20). My point is: Be calm, go about your life, know you made a good decision with $GNUS, and sleep well.

What remains outstanding is still bearish price action in the stock market then I will start to short the stock market.

6/2/20, 07:56 PM;;1;4;"WSJ: $SBUX to further reduce employee hours in the US as sales remain down amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

In a letter, Rossann Williams, Starbucks' president for its US and Canada business, told employees that the company will further adjust employee hours to meet sales demand, as well as to spread hours across more workers as they return to their jobs, the report said.

The coffee giant has encouraged employees to take unpaid leave until September after it decided to keep dining rooms at most of its US cafes temporarily closed, the Journal reported.

Last month, Starbucks reported US same-store sales declined 35% to 45% year over year, even after the company restored modified service to more than 85% of its cafes."

5/29/20, 03:20 AM;Bearish;6;4;$LK it‚Äôs sad for those that got burned on false premises. Sure, good for those riding that fake pump and making a killing, but this is dead. If you come to China, I dare you to find a Luckin close by. Their stores are in weird, far locations and majority cannot even make ends meet. If Chinese drink coffee other than their houses (small percentage drink coffee as tea is preferred), they go to $SBUX, 85 Cafe or Costa, or the tens of thousands cute cafes all over. New details came in today exposing more financial dishonesty. Luckin coffee is viewed as the cheap, watered version of 85 Cafe and they mostly provide coupons and vouchers for free coffee. Don‚Äôt believe the hype, you should‚Äôve invested in something promising and undervalued out there
