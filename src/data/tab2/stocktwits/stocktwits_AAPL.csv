 Low-interest rates could expand PE multiples. But rates have risen sharply in recent weeks. These HIGHER RATES are making the stock market more expensive when compared to bond yields. 

If stocks need to reprice for this shift in rates, it could result in a rather steep equity MARKET SELL-OFF, perhaps more than 20%.

With a spread currently at 2.5% versus a 200-day moving average of 2.8% and a historical average of 4.24% since 1997, it would imply that rising rates on the 10-year Treasury and 10-year TIPS could harm equities, resulting in a MASSIVE REPRICING

There is NOT MUCH AMMUNITION LEFT for the broad market.

Sentiment and positioning are extreme and persisted for several weeks at elevated levels. Technicals signal some residual upside but their case deteriorates. 

The market is probably steering towards a PAINFUL REVERSAL in the next weeks.

ERODING TRUST IN THE FED could lead to higher interest rates
- A sustained break above 1.50% in the 10y Treasury Rate is the first milestone for a technical reversal. It has the potential to send shockwaves through the financial system and force policymakers to increase their stakes once again. Once things get out of control, they do so quickly.

A volatile sideways market probably leads to a cyclical high at some point in first half of 2021. 

THE RUBBER BAND HAS BEEN STRETCHED VERY FAR

The next CORRECTION is likely to display similar characteristics as the early 2020 and late 2018 crashes.  $SPY $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL

1. The S&P 500’s market value sits at an all-time high of 140% of US GDP versus a six-decade average of 62%.
2. Margin debt at all-time high, whether measured against the S&P 500 or GDP. When investors get highly levered they get hammered when the market tanks.
3. Every major S&P 500 sector, other than health care, is trading at double-digit premium to 20-year average P/E multiple. The S&P premium is 37% and spans 12-93%.
4. The small cap benchmark Russell 2000 vs 200-day moving average, is at a record of more than 40%.

 History Repeats...
One by one, the weakest of the dot-coms began to underperform. Dot-coms ceased being sure stock market winners — in a trickle, and then all at once. Falling stock prices turned into stock market delistings and then became actual bankruptcies. On January 14, 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at 11,722.98, a level it would not return to for more than six years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq peaked on March 10, 2000, at 5,048.62, a level it would not reach again until March 2015. From that March 2000 peak, all the way down to the trough it reached on October 9, 2002 (the bear market bottom would be 1,114.11), the Nasdaq would lose nearly 80 percent of its value.

Hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer (Elliot Mgmt) believes the market is out of whack and warns wagers on bitcoin and richly valued companies like electric-vehicle maker Tesla, championed in his estimation by an investment mob, will eventually have him and his team at Elliott declaring, “We told you so.”

Bloomberg reported that Elliott Management, which braced for the pandemic stock-market crash far earlier than other investors, made money in every month of 2020, even during the carnage of March. Stock benchmarks hit the year’s nadir on the 23rd of that month.

Elliott, which manages more than $40 billion, has registered annualized gains of about 13% in its 44 years, beating the S&P 500 index. Singer’s net worth, meanwhile, stands at $3.6 billion, according to Forbes.  $QQQ $SPY $AAPL $TSLA

Three years ago, Buffett told CNBC that he believes the average person's connection to their iPhone was strong enough that most people would pay much more for the device than they do now.  
 
""I focus on the ... hundreds, hundreds, hundreds millions of people who practically live their lives by [the iPhone],"" Buffett said at the time.

“The stock market is significantly overvalued according to the Buffett Indicator,” said researchers at GuruFocus. “Based on the historical ratio of total market cap over GDP (currently at 187.5%), it is likely to return -2.5% a year from this level of valuation, including dividends.”

The current levels are down from the record high of 195.7% hit just a few weeks ago. Even still, the figure remains well above the 159.2% seen just before the dot-com bubble.

One by one, the weakest of the dot-coms began to underperform. Dot-coms ceased being sure stock market winners — in a trickle, and then all at once. Falling stock prices turned into stock market delistings and then became actual bankruptcies. On January 14, 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at 11,722.98, a level it would not return to for more than six years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq peaked on March 10, 2000, at 5,048.62, a level it would not reach again until March 2015. From that March 2000 peak, all the way down to the trough it reached on October 9, 2002 (the bear market bottom would be 1,114.11), the Nasdaq would lose nearly 80 percent of its value."

3/2/21, 08:42 PM;;1;0;"$UVXY        Margin calls could break the market...
The surge cost Wall Street investors almost $20 billion in mark-to-market losses, according to data from S3 Partners. Peterffy’s brokerage spent the day issuing thousands of margin calls on its customers’ bearish GameStop bets, forcing them to exit their trades. The move, they later said, was to conserve cash as their clearinghouses demanded money to cover potential customer losses amid the fervent speculation. 

Peterffy went to bed that night worried of a market collapse. 

While Interactive Brokers has $9 billion of equity, some newer online brokerages have less resources. 

“If the broker has to pay more money to the clearinghouse for customer losses than he has, then the broker is bankrupt. And when one broker goes bankrupt, usually a few others do too,” he told Forbes late on Thursday evening. “So, I'm worried about a systemic failure.”

If investors, particularly institutional investors, begin moving out of some of the frothier growth stocks into other investments, that could trigger a sell-off in growth stocks and potentially TRIGGER MARGIN CALLS

The question of it being an orderly sell-off remains an open one. Investors who remember the bursting of the tech bubble 21 years ago may not wait around to see if the sell-off is orderly or not. Fear of missing out could turn to a fear of steep losses in a hurry. That could lead to another mass exit as a herd mentality takes hold, as it did following previous market bubbles.

The Basel-based institution, known as the central banker’s central bank, highlighted the record highs reached by stock markets in February and fired a warning shot over highly leveraged share trades that “raise concerns about market functioning”.

The BIS said that market chaos was made worse by the actions of groups such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, which used options to trigger a 20-fold increase in GameStop’s shares in January, boosting their bets on the stock with borrowed money.

“There is evidence that retail investors are currently taking risky one-way bets, as rapid surges in margin debt have been followed by periods of stock market declines.”

A surge in equity fundraising using listed “blank cheque” companies - which raise money without an immediate investment plan to buy private businesses - “revived memories of the late 1990s tech boom.”  $SPY $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL

The problem for the market is that markets have priced in a speedy recovery back to pre-recession norms, no secondary outbreak of the virus, and a vaccine. If such does turn out to be the case, the Federal Reserve will have a huge problem. 

The “unlimited QE” bazooka is dependent on the Fed needing to monetize the deficit and support economic growth. However, if full employment and economic growth get quickly reached, the Fed will face a potential “inflation surge.” 

Such will put the Fed into a very tight box... a no-win situation. 

The surge in inflation will limit their ability to continue “unlimited QE” without further exacerbating the inflation problem. However, if they don’t “monetize” the deficit through their “QE” program, interest rates will surge, leading to an economic recession. 

Each time rates have “spiked” in the past; it has generally preceded a mild to a severe market correction.

3/2/21, 08:15 PM;;0;0;"$UVXY Burry (The Big Short) says margin debt will pop bubble...
Speculative stock #bubbles ultimately see the gamblers take on too much debt. #MarginDebt popularity accelerates at peaks. At this point the market is dancing on a knife’s edge. Passive investing’s IQ drain, and #stonksgoup hype, add to the danger

Burry is concerned about rising margin debt. He points out that major market tops are usually foreshadowed by peaks in margin debt. That was the case in 2000 and again in 2008. Adding to this danger is complacency caused by the rise of indexing and the exit of professional traders. A new generation of amateur traders who have never experienced a bear market are stepping in, and they are woefully unprepared.

But even more, Burry points out that the true leverage in the system is masked by the use of options, which have massive inherent leverage. $SPY $QQQ $AAPL

The Basel-based institution, known as the central banker’s central bank, highlighted the record highs reached by stock markets in February and fired a warning shot over highly leveraged share trades that “raise concerns about market functioning”.

The BIS said that market chaos was made worse by the actions of groups such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, which used options to trigger a 20-fold increase in GameStop’s shares in January, boosting their bets on the stock with borrowed money.

“There is evidence that retail investors are currently taking risky one-way bets, as rapid surges in margin debt have been followed by periods of stock market declines.”

Bloomberg reported that Elliott Management, which braced for the pandemic stock-market crash far earlier than other investors, made money in every month of 2020, even during the carnage of March. Stock benchmarks hit the year’s nadir on the 23rd of that month.

Elliott, which manages more than $40 billion, has registered annualized gains of about 13% in its 44 years, beating the S&P 500 index. Singer’s net worth, meanwhile, stands at $3.6 billion, according to Forbes. $QQQ $SPY $AAPL

The Basel-based institution, known as the central banker’s central bank, highlighted the record highs reached by stock markets in February and fired a warning shot over highly leveraged share trades that “raise concerns about market functioning”.

The BIS said that market chaos was made worse by the actions of groups such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, which used options to trigger a 20-fold increase in GameStop’s shares in January, boosting their bets on the stock with borrowed money.

“There is evidence that retail investors are currently taking risky one-way bets, as rapid surges in margin debt have been followed by periods of stock market declines.”

A surge in equity fundraising using listed “blank cheque” companies - which raise money without an immediate investment plan to buy private businesses - “revived memories of the late 1990s tech boom”.   $SPY $QQQ

$FUBO $AAPL $BABA $AMZN 
RECENT EVENT REACTION: Roku's partnership with Nielsen should push the streaming platform's revenue growth past consensus' 55% this year, and could nudge it over 65% if the addressable TV advertising market tops eMarketer's $3.6 billion by 2022. That's because improving ad measurement is key to accelerating the shift in advertising spending to streaming from the $50 billion traditional TV industry, given digital ads' superior return on investment and expanding reach."

There are too many bubbles in the market right now. This giant bubble need to be busted. It’s hard to believe that it is $120 billion market cap with $623 million revenue compared to  Northrop Grumman $49 billion in market cap with $36.79 billion in revenue. One makes stealth aircrafts and real high tech stuffs compared to the other one with only one product which has spying scandal and a lot of competitors. 

Remember market will have more corrections in the next few months, and so far more than 15% of U.S population have been vaccinated plus more new vaccines approved every 2-3 months.

Yes, there are a lot of people will still remain working at home, but a lot will com back offices, kids need go back schools, and even patients need to see doctors. I start to see some traffic jams in my area. There are no more room to grow for this company 

P/s: even though its market cap is around $30 billion($100/share), it still looks overvalued

Apple ’s Initial Order for iPhone 13s Could Hit 100 Million

That is according to one analyst’s reading of the supply-chain tea leaves. It would compare with an initial build of 80 million iPhone 12 units in 2020.

The next iPhone lineup likely won’t be unveiled until September, but Apple begins to work with its suppliers months in advance. If its initial iPhone 13 order is in fact 25% larger than it was for the iPhone 12, that is a sign that management expects the 5G-driven smartphone upgrade cycle to last well into next year."

Okay folks listen up, we are in a strong Bull Market boosted by 10 trillion dollars in stimulus with more on the way. That type of cash infusion has never happened in the history of our economy. 

Unfortunately there are the nasty type of people called Perma Bears. They run around like chicken little screaming that the economy is going to collapse or that we are due for a 10% correction. The fact is, these people are either sitting on the sideline with cash waiting to buy in at a lower price or they are short. You don’t want to be one of these people and lose out on days like yesterday. 

We are still in the bottom trading range of this bull market and still have plenty upside. Tech is still cheap, very cheap. The bonds are worthless back when I was a teenager, you could make 5-6% in your savings account. We are nowhere near that. 

Watch Cramer below on why you should be BUYING not selling:

Bull-case: Nothing is concrete unless SPY gaps down, rebounds, crosses $393 and heads over $400 and above. Until all that happens, every bull trend is a trap. 
Bear case: Nothing concrete unless spy keeps closing below $390, and fails below its support levels around $376. It would still be a maximum of 5% down and wont go lower than that. In case it goes more than 5% below $376, that would be a very strong indicator of a crash like event."

Asia is seeing the writing on the wall.  The stimulus bill will not provide SUSTAINED consumer spending, and if it propels yields further, there will absolutely be a panic to reduce investment.  Asia, most notably Japan, has largely been cautious toward the credit market for a long time and many companies (and countries) have had plans to refinance their near term debt at low rates .  If yields creep higher and consumption slows, there there will be a ton of debt that can't be serviced and we could see another great financial crisis."

3/2/21, 04:58 AM;Bullish;22;0;$AAPL Need someone knowledgeable about Options to help me here. I’ve got some March 2023 $160 calls. I’m down over 30% right now but not too concerned. I am a bit puzzled by today’s price action in the options market. The stock moved up over 5% but barely any movement in my calls from the day before. Up only 0.66% today. More confusing is what E*TRADE was showing earlier in the day and after market close. Please observe the two images. When the price for the option was $15.65, it showed I was up $325. After market close, the price for the option was $16.10 but I was only up $100. It doesn’t make any sense. Any insight is appreciated.

2. PR this morning. New global Fortune 10 tech client ordered seven units for their newest high-traffic warehouse (hint: McKesson's new vaccine facility in Louisville)
3. CVS Health (Fortune #5) was revealed as a client a couple weeks ago in a product picture. They've made repeat, scaled-up orders.  That makes TWO FORTUNE 10 CLIENTS.
4. ""Dramatically improved"" 10K coming in the next 60 days.

- Revolutionary products, an engaging CEO, in an emerging market, dominating market share, upfront and recurring revenues on all products, repeat and scaled up orders.
- AITX just makes sense. Automation is replacing manpower and saving businesses money while providing a BETTER work performance. Anyone discovering AITX has an opportunity to get in at the exact perfect time.

3/2/21, 01:17 AM;;0;2;"Sell put-call strategy:  
 
I took $AAPL historical data since 2012 and asked how much its price has changed after 1 day, 5 days, 10 days, and 15 days. The charts show the distribution of fractional changes after N days (N ∈ {1, 5, 10, 15}). Then I said ok, let's imagine I want to sell Put (Call) options 7% (8%) below (above) the market's price on Monday before it gets expired. Then I ask what fraction of my puts (calls) are not assigned after 5 days -- assuming I would not sell or roll them. It turns out historically only 3% of them could have been assigned (the numbers in the blue and purple text boxes).   
 
If on Mondy of every week I sell put and call options on average over yea 3% of time times I have to buy them or sell them, Put and Call assignments almost cancel one another over time, after many years I will only collect premiums and the difference between put/call buy/sells (which is positive).

3/1/21, 10:13 PM;;0;3;$AAPL How did that trade work on the 24th?  Apple is up 4.3% from my exit price, but my #Bitcoin is up more, 10.2% since my add on Sunday.  My $FIX buy on 2-26 is +9.6%.  AAPL can bounce (5.5% today), but my sense was there were better choices.  The stock should not have been in a strong down trend if things are going perfectly with the 5G thesis.  Could be wrong, but I acted on it.  I also, as many do, own plenty of Apple shares indirectly in SPYs and QQQs.  Extra exposure in a weaker stock is not on the menu for me.  Apple is lagging the SPX by about 13.5% off the AAPL ATH.  Love the company, but there are too many strong stocks in this market to not decrease exposure to those with relative underperformance.  IMO.
3/1/21, 10:13 PM;;0;4;$AAPL this is the first day in over a month that Apple hasn’t ended in the red. Weird to see it, like watching a goat walk on its hind legs and speak in tongues. My call option is now only slightly less worthless 🥴

3/1/21, 1:45 PM
March 1, 2021 01:45 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst Color

The iPhone supercycle that kickstarted with the launch of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 will likely continue well into 2022, according to analysts at Wedbush Securities.

The Apple Analyst: Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating on Apple and a 12-month price target of $175, with the bull-case price target at $225.

The Apple Thesis: The next iPhone iteration, namely the iPhone 13, will likely be launched around September, Ives said. Initial Asia supply chain builds for iPhone 13 are in the 100-million-unit range compared to the firm's initial iPhone 12 reads of 80 million, he added."

Apple Will Have To Buyback $250 Billion In Stock To Become Cash Neutral

During Apple’s earnings conference call on February1,2018,Luca Maestri,the company’s CFO,stated that due to changes in the tax laws,Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company.Our current net cash position is $163 billion.And given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash,we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time.

(03)years Apple’s net cash position has essentially been halved while it has bought back 9.4 billion split-adjusted shares or 35% of them.Using the estimates below it should take Apple another three years and $250 billion to get to a neutral cash position.

* Current net cash position,fiscal 2020:$79 billion
* Estimated free cash flow per year:$70 billion
* Dividend payments per year:$14 billion
* Net increase in cash per year:$56 billion

""Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds"" - Peter Lynch 

 Look at Tuesday & Friday. Did your stocks bounce? Did your losers  show some sign of life? I bring this up cause I can tell you now I believe we have entered a time of some extreme volatility. I'm not speaking of the VIX. I've seen mkts go straight down and the VIX go right down with it. I'm talking about a lot of headfakes - in both directions. I think it's prudent to reassess what your holding. Hope is not a good trading strategy. 

In Friday's post, and again in my post this morning (SEE BELOW), I mentioned that there were a lot of reasons the mkt should break lower to 3690/3710 But .. my caution is the mkt tends to try and catch the most offsides. I also mentioned get ready for fireworks, a 30 handle move or more is coming Monday in either direction. As of this writing, we are up .. 30 handles. Buckle up. ✌"

""Kubernetes can be thought of as an OS for the cluster.""

I am completely fine with this analogy.

Shopify as an ""OS"" for e-commerce is not only a meaningless buzzword but doesn't even make any sense in the context of their technology stack. It's like saying $WMT is a ""Retail OS"", a better word to use would be ecosystem if anything.

Although even that would be more of a buzzword than accurate, because it similarly implies a difficult barrier to entry due to growing reliance (i.e $AAPL Ecosystem), which Shopify doesn't have. At least it's more meaningful than calling it an OS.

Yes... This bugs me more than it should. lol

So, there is very little chance that last week's mess will be duplicated and a pretty good chance that there will be some rebound.

A few ticks higher won't kill the mkt, it's the rapid spikes to worry about. We closed right at support, and while I have projected more pain ahead, perhaps to the 3690-3710 area, bulls still have a chance. Why? Cause of the way the mkt closed and the overall negative sentiment. Factor in the weakness in my two sentiment indicators  - TSLA and Bitcoin, and to me the next leg sets up for more downside. Which leads me to something I've mentioned many times, the mkt likes to catch the majority offsides. If we hold lows of last week, I'd expect a moderate bounce. On the upside I think we need to break above 3850 to regain momentum. Friday I mentioned we will have ""fireworks"" on Monday. And that we will see 30 handles or more in one direction or the other. I expect that to occur. Remember - be nimble, limited losses, and have patience. I'll be back tonight with an earnings play or two ✌"

It’s all about long term outlook and trend. Your future success is based on the strength of your portfolio not just today’s balance sheet . For those investing money they need to careful. And for those investing using their margin accounts not a good idea. If you have a balanced portfolio your in a good place regardless of tomorrow’s or next weeks results. Lastly avoid chasing the dollar let the dollar come to you by investing in profitable companies. Best of luck to all you guys, just wanted through in my two cents"

As many expectFed to come out this week with messaging  stabilizing inflation expectations after last week's yield surge and nearly failed 7yr auction on Thursday, it's hard to imagine how they are going to pull all of this off. I continue to think there will be some near term abatement in equity market concerns and rotation out of long duration assets like big tech names, coupled with lots of new money pumping into the system that is unlikely to be headed into just things like regional banks and utilities. 

However, this imbalance is probably temporary. Supply side forecast of stimulus plus Fed balance sheet reduction is only a medium term issue. Yield growth abatement likely for now, allowing rebound in big names like $AMZN, $AAPL, $FB, etc but later this year  inflation expectations will come. So short term bullish, long term cautious.

Because of Apple’s buybacks, however, which reduce the total number of outstanding shares, Berkshires ownership of AAPL has increased to 5.4% despite that sale:

Since then, we have both enjoyed regular dividends, averaging about $775 million annually, and have also – in 2020 – pocketed an additional $11 billion by selling a small portion of our position.

Despite that sale – voila! – Berkshire now owns 5.4% of Apple. That increase was costless to us, coming about because Apple has continuously repurchased its shares, thereby substantially shrinking the number it now has outstanding."

Hello bulls...
Look at the 5 year chart of AAPL...last year it rallied like never before...
Just because big money moved out of the covid hit stocks and put the monwy into stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG just to avoid massive losses...
Now all that money is being pulled out...and apple has split the stock and now it has 18 billion float which no one cared about it...so it is not a surprising move if everyone is dumping this shit...
Also, due to the Gamestop issue, lot of hedge funds had to sell stocks like AAPL, AMD and other tech to have liquid cash to earn back their losses...
Now the problem is they have to buy back these shares at low prices...hence they are shorting heavily with all reasons....and they will buy back at say 85$...and then ride it up...."

Last year during March the markets never really crashed.. the FED came in and saved the markets mid 30-35% downturn without the FED stepping in things would’ve been a lot worse.. now that interest rates are already at 0.00% how will the FED save the markets? Continued QE and money printing will only cause yields to further increase putting pressure on markets. These new investors and Wallstreetbets kids will be wiped out when they experience their first real market crash. When markets crater 50-80% of the course of 3 years... good luck with those leap options, weeklie gamblers won’t touch the market ever again they’ll be shaking a van on the streets

It's to show that a very successful week takes research. It takes homework. I've mentioned this to you before - you can't wake up in the morning and just ""wing"" it. That's a sure recipe for losses. Have a gameplan. The people who have gameplans never say ""it's manipulation"", or blame shorts, or call other traders stupid for not buying, or blame algos, etc. They don't need to. They have a gameplan. And if it doesn't work, they move on to their next one. And one very important note. And I can't mention this enough ... take losses. For God's sake, learn to take losses. People are holding on to the most speculative SPACs like RMO, THCB, HYLN, etc. Junk. They are broken. You should set a mental limit and move on. 7.5 out of my 10 trades are profitable. But if I don't manage  those 2.5  losing trades, they can wipe out the 7-8 gains. Be disciplined. Till Sunday ...✌"

2/27/21, 02:53 AM;Bullish;27;24;"$CCIV
Here’s a thought;

During his post merger news release interview with CNBC, Peter Rawlinson stated:
“We are attracting the bluest of blue chip companies”
Now I don’t know about you, but to me, there’s only one company that I’d label as bluest of blue chip...

That company has recently announced their entry in the EV market.
That company has also expressed interest in partnering with an existing EV manufacturer.
And that company already has a connection to Lucid because of a previous employee now working on the Lucid board of directors.

Just imagine...

$AAPL & Lucid 🤯

Last point;

So I don’t think Lucid is a $TSLA killer on their own, but with Apple behind them? Oh boy.

And remember how after Apple’s EV announcement Elon was quick to throw it in Tim’s face that years ago Apple turned him down?

So all I’m saying is, Apple wants to be the leader in everything, Lucid has the leading EV tech and factories by 2024 and both Tim and Peter want to surpass Tesla.

Sunday night I posted I would sell both NVDA and OSTK into earnings. NVDA lost about $70 and OSTK $35 for the week. Monday I mentioned we would likely sell off to 3800-3810, which we did. On Wednesday I mentioned I was buying GME  in AHrs at $84, it went to $200. I also mentioned I was buying $UVXY at $8.3, it exploded the next day up 30% . I also mentioned I would buy ZS for an earnings play, it popped $28 today. And that I would buy FTCH first thing this morning off an outstanding earnings report  - which the street misinterpreted. It popped  $6 from $60 off open. Finally, I posted I bought BYND at $139 in AHrs yesterday. It popped to $166 this morning. The only one I partially got wrong was STPK. I mentioned you can dip the toe at $36  and again at $32.

Then they bought them back for cheaper. Tech might be overvalued , but who will be left standing in the long run
2/26/21, 11:34 PM;Bullish;2;8;$AAPL During the last selloff since September the lows were 9/21-$103, 11/2- $107.32, 11/24- $112.59, 2/26- $121.20.  These are reflective of higher highs.  The next higher high will most likely be $155 in the coming couple of weeks.  Hold on and have faith as this stock's climb is stretched out more.  By holding this position for the past 6 months, I have studied its movement every day because it was in my face every day and realized that it's a 6-month process and I can only go in and out of AAPL two times a year.  Hope this helps a bit for those wanting a different perspective.

Of course, this will also applicable for Biotech, general electronics such as $AAPL, military, space, and a host of other sectors that need advanced chip production.  By the way, ICE car makers too may have to buy Dragonfly machines to produce less sophisticated chips that chip makers don't want to produce since less money to be made by producing chips for ICE.

How many 10-20 handles moves within minutes were we going to have today? Only to have a massive drop into the close. And what does that say about the overall mkt? I'll give you my opinion ... we are sitting right at a key support level, so it's a massive battle between bulls vs bears. And while I've been pretty vocal that I do believe there is more pain ahead, and a visit to my 3690-3710 level, a bounce off this level would make me rethink that thesis. That nasty close was ugly. And if you spent the day in a stock like AAPL, which dropped $3 in last few minutes, it felt pretty painful and probably very defeating. One thing is for sure, or at least I think it is for sure, there are going to be some fireworks come Monday. Meaning, I think we will see at least 30 handles in one direction or the other. If we only know which✌"

2/26/21, 08:55 PM;;1;1;"US drops a Trump admin demand in global corporate-tax negotiations, removing one obstacle to an agreement on adapting the tax system to the digital economy.

Treasury Sec Yellen said that the US would no longer insist on a ""safe harbor"" under which some elements of the tax rules would be optional. The idea, proposed in late 2019 by her predecessor, Mnuchin, drew objections from European counterparts, though talks on how it would work never advanced.

Ms. Yellen said the US would continue to engage on both parts of the tax project being led by the OECD: a push to redefine where corporate income is taxed & a parallel effort to impose minimum taxes.

Corp profits are taxed where value is created, not where customers are located. Negotiators have sought to give countries where international co.s operate more power to tax them. In the absence of a deal, some have imposed digital-service taxes that are levies on the co.s' revs from those jurisdictions.

Bond Yield buzz was just BS from media to short the market.

BlackRock's bond chief Rick Rieder breaks down why he's not worried rising yields will hurt the stock market

Economic data suggests that the US will see an ""explosive growth rate,"" and markets are anticipating that yields will have to move higher.
""I'm not that worried about equities,"" Rieder said.

It is funny and sad at the same time that during the past few months many new young investors have joined under the assumption that the market is always green. Unfortunately for a lot of these kids, they invested way more than is smart or practical and now they will pay the price, because they probably need that money to pay rent or buy weed. For the rest of us, time to take a break from constantly staring at the screen, and/or use this time as a fantastic buying opportunity, and then sit back, relax and wait. The world is not ending.

2/26/21, 05:02 AM;Bullish;4;3;"The saga of the so called ""meme stocks"" will continue, personally I believe this is a free market, so no stock should be labeled as a ""meme stock"".  A lot of calls went quickly in the money today then some stocks halted. Market makers that need to cover those options probably got exposed to risk. With the move up after hours, it suggests there were enough shares for sale to cover the calls. Market makers will be actively looking to accumulate big blocks of shares. Every time shares go higher, more shares need to be bought.Fore one stock there are so many $800 calls that I’m not sure there would be enough shares available. The interactive broker founder saying in late January that 200 million shares would need to be bought with only 50 million available would cause the stock to go into the thousands. I think we’re looking at the same situation only this round there’s more diamond hands, Robinhood is better capitalized, and more people moved to better brokers.

2/26/21, 04:47 AM;;26;37;$SPY $TSLA $UVXY $AAPL $MP Flashback Friday ... a year ago I was warning my followers to exit the mkt while we were trading near all-time highs.  (SEE BELOW) Those who followed me back then remember me recommending TVIX at $38 (which eventually went to $999). My call yesterday on buying UVXY at $8.3 is not comparable to today. Nor do I think the mkt is going to crash by any means. But there were so many young traders that got wiped out. They had never seen a sharp correction let alone a bear mkt. All they knew was anything they buy will go higher. Fast forward today and I see that same mentality. New investors/traders just keep holding broken stocks. Keep believing pie in the sky outlooks by company CEOs. Keep piling into crappy names - many of which  are new SPACs. No, we aren't going to crash. But if you bought STPK at $51 and tomorrow it trades down to $28, it's going to feel like a crash. My guess is more pain tomorrow. So don't get too excited with tonight's jump in futures. ✌

But we all know the dreaded inflation scare is “actually” no longer in the future, it is appearing before our very eyes. However, despite the dreaded news understand this simple following point and reread it if you have to;

Tim has a perfect record of pulling rabbits out of his hat. Not 70, 80 or 90......100. Stick with Tim and you will win. Repeat after me, stick with Tim and you will win.

Project titan will be the needle to the bubble. Only the strongest will survive, (cue the beating of war drums).

NNDM looks ok in the $9’s.  We might also see a lil rally with pot stocks; quick in and outs with OGI + VFF. 

Sold my NIO puts. Not touching it till ER & 2nd dilution.

You'll be alright, long term. Good luck."

""The supercycle theme being articulated, that phrase makes me worried. ...

2/26/21, 12:08 AM;Bullish;0;3;$AAPL $NUGT $DIS Strong sustainable recovery is right around the corner and prices will rise as demand comes roaring back. In this type of environment, bond yields should be higher regardless of whether the Fed raises interest rates. Currencies are particularly sensitive to interest rates, which explains why the U.S. dollar had such a significant reaction to the 10% spike. The same is true for stocks. Rising yields increase borrowing costs and affect the discretionary incomes of consumers. A 1% to 1.5% increase is big on a percentage basis
