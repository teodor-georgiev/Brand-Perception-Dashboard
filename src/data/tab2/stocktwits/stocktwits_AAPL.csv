 Low-interest rates could expand PE multiples. But rates have risen sharply in recent weeks. These HIGHER RATES are making the stock market more expensive when compared to bond yields. 

If stocks need to reprice for this shift in rates, it could result in a rather steep equity MARKET SELL-OFF, perhaps more than 20%.

With a spread currently at 2.5% versus a 200-day moving average of 2.8% and a historical average of 4.24% since 1997, it would imply that rising rates on the 10-year Treasury and 10-year TIPS could harm equities, resulting in a MASSIVE REPRICING

There is NOT MUCH AMMUNITION LEFT for the broad market.

Sentiment and positioning are extreme and persisted for several weeks at elevated levels. Technicals signal some residual upside but their case deteriorates. 

The market is probably steering towards a PAINFUL REVERSAL in the next weeks.

ERODING TRUST IN THE FED could lead to higher interest rates
- A sustained break above 1.50% in the 10y Treasury Rate is the first milestone for a technical reversal. It has the potential to send shockwaves through the financial system and force policymakers to increase their stakes once again. Once things get out of control, they do so quickly.

A volatile sideways market probably leads to a cyclical high at some point in first half of 2021. 

THE RUBBER BAND HAS BEEN STRETCHED VERY FAR

The next CORRECTION is likely to display similar characteristics as the early 2020 and late 2018 crashes.  $SPY $QQQ $TSLA $AAPL

2. Margin debt at all-time high, whether measured against the S&P 500 or GDP. When investors get highly levered they get hammered when the market tanks.
3. Every major S&P 500 sector, other than health care, is trading at double-digit premium to 20-year average P/E multiple. The S&P premium is 37% and spans 12-93%.
4. The small cap benchmark Russell 2000 vs 200-day moving average, is at a record of more than 40%.

 History Repeats...
One by one, the weakest of the dot-coms began to underperform. Dot-coms ceased being sure stock market winners ‚Äî in a trickle, and then all at once. Falling stock prices turned into stock market delistings and then became actual bankruptcies. On January 14, 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at 11,722.98, a level it would not return to for more than six years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq peaked on March 10, 2000, at 5,048.62, a level it would not reach again until March 2015. From that March 2000 peak, all the way down to the trough it reached on October 9, 2002 (the bear market bottom would be 1,114.11), the Nasdaq would lose nearly 80 percent of its value.

The current levels are down from the record high of 195.7% hit just a few weeks ago. Even still, the figure remains well above the 159.2% seen just before the dot-com bubble.

While Interactive Brokers has $9 billion of equity, some newer online brokerages have less resources. 

‚ÄúIf the broker has to pay more money to the clearinghouse for customer losses than he has, then the broker is bankrupt. And when one broker goes bankrupt, usually a few others do too,‚Äù he told Forbes late on Thursday evening. ‚ÄúSo, I'm worried about a systemic failure.‚Äù

If investors, particularly institutional investors, begin moving out of some of the frothier growth stocks into other investments, that could trigger a sell-off in growth stocks and potentially TRIGGER MARGIN CALLS

The question of it being an orderly sell-off remains an open one. Investors who remember the bursting of the tech bubble 21 years ago may not wait around to see if the sell-off is orderly or not. Fear of missing out could turn to a fear of steep losses in a hurry. That could lead to another mass exit as a herd mentality takes hold, as it did following previous market bubbles.

The problem for the market is that markets have priced in a speedy recovery back to pre-recession norms, no secondary outbreak of the virus, and a vaccine. If such does turn out to be the case, the Federal Reserve will have a huge problem. 

The ‚Äúunlimited QE‚Äù bazooka is dependent on the Fed needing to monetize the deficit and support economic growth. However, if full employment and economic growth get quickly reached, the Fed will face a potential ‚Äúinflation surge.‚Äù 

Such will put the Fed into a very tight box... a no-win situation. 

The surge in inflation will limit their ability to continue ‚Äúunlimited QE‚Äù without further exacerbating the inflation problem. However, if they don‚Äôt ‚Äúmonetize‚Äù the deficit through their ‚ÄúQE‚Äù program, interest rates will surge, leading to an economic recession. 

Each time rates have ‚Äúspiked‚Äù in the past; it has generally preceded a mild to a severe market correction.

Speculative stock #bubbles ultimately see the gamblers take on too much debt. #MarginDebt popularity accelerates at peaks. At this point the market is dancing on a knife‚Äôs edge. Passive investing‚Äôs IQ drain, and #stonksgoup hype, add to the danger

Burry is concerned about rising margin debt. He points out that major market tops are usually foreshadowed by peaks in margin debt. That was the case in 2000 and again in 2008. Adding to this danger is complacency caused by the rise of indexing and the exit of professional traders. A new generation of amateur traders who have never experienced a bear market are stepping in, and they are woefully unprepared.

But even more, Burry points out that the true leverage in the system is masked by the use of options, which have massive inherent leverage. $SPY $QQQ $AAPL

The Basel-based institution, known as the central banker‚Äôs central bank, highlighted the record highs reached by stock markets in February and fired a warning shot over highly leveraged share trades that ‚Äúraise concerns about market functioning‚Äù.

The BIS said that market chaos was made worse by the actions of groups such as Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum, which used options to trigger a 20-fold increase in GameStop‚Äôs shares in January, boosting their bets on the stock with borrowed money.

‚ÄúThere is evidence that retail investors are currently taking risky one-way bets, as rapid surges in margin debt have been followed by periods of stock market declines.‚Äù

A surge in equity fundraising using listed ‚Äúblank cheque‚Äù companies - which raise money without an immediate investment plan to buy private businesses - ‚Äúrevived memories of the late 1990s tech boom‚Äù.   $SPY $QQQ

There are too many bubbles in the market right now. This giant bubble need to be busted. It‚Äôs hard to believe that it is $120 billion market cap with $623 million revenue compared to  Northrop Grumman $49 billion in market cap with $36.79 billion in revenue. One makes stealth aircrafts and real high tech stuffs compared to the other one with only one product which has spying scandal and a lot of competitors. 

Remember market will have more corrections in the next few months, and so far more than 15% of U.S population have been vaccinated plus more new vaccines approved every 2-3 months.

Yes, there are a lot of people will still remain working at home, but a lot will com back offices, kids need go back schools, and even patients need to see doctors. I start to see some traffic jams in my area. There are no more room to grow for this company 

P/s: even though its market cap is around $30 billion($100/share), it still looks overvalued

Apple ‚Äôs Initial Order for iPhone 13s Could Hit 100 Million

The next iPhone lineup likely won‚Äôt be unveiled until September, but Apple begins to work with its suppliers months in advance. If its initial iPhone 13 order is in fact 25% larger than it was for the iPhone 12, that is a sign that management expects the 5G-driven smartphone upgrade cycle to last well into next year."

3/2/21, 12:43 PM;Bullish;0;4;$AAPL  Bears trying so hard to convince that Apple will fall. Future, Asia, Europe, etc. only impact premarket, nothing else. We can still go down, but stop sprouting nonsense.
3/2/21, 12:42 PM;Bullish;10;15;"$AMD $AAPL $LULU $SPY $QQQ 

Okay folks listen up, we are in a strong Bull Market boosted by 10 trillion dollars in stimulus with more on the way. That type of cash infusion has never happened in the history of our economy. 

Unfortunately there are the nasty type of people called Perma Bears. They run around like chicken little screaming that the economy is going to collapse or that we are due for a 10% correction. The fact is, these people are either sitting on the sideline with cash waiting to buy in at a lower price or they are short. You don‚Äôt want to be one of these people and lose out on days like yesterday. 

We are still in the bottom trading range of this bull market and still have plenty upside. Tech is still cheap, very cheap. The bonds are worthless back when I was a teenager, you could make 5-6% in your savings account. We are nowhere near that. 

Watch Cramer below on why you should be BUYING not selling:

3/2/21, 12:40 PM;;2;4;$AAPL already bought back in this is a good company to buy and hold
3/2/21, 12:38 PM;;5;4;"$QQQ $SPY $AAPL $BA Current Options rating has not been changed to ‚Äúgreed‚Äù yet. The indicator is still in ‚ÄúExtreme Fear‚Äù. 
Proceed with caution. 
A bull-case could be a trap. 
A bear-case could be a trap. 
Bull-case: Nothing is concrete unless SPY gaps down, rebounds, crosses $393 and heads over $400 and above. Until all that happens, every bull trend is a trap. 
Bear case: Nothing concrete unless spy keeps closing below $390, and fails below its support levels around $376. It would still be a maximum of 5% down and wont go lower than that. In case it goes more than 5% below $376, that would be a very strong indicator of a crash like event."

3. CVS Health (Fortune #5) was revealed as a client a couple weeks ago in a product picture. They've made repeat, scaled-up orders.  That makes TWO FORTUNE 10 CLIENTS.
4. ""Dramatically improved"" 10K coming in the next 60 days.

- Revolutionary products, an engaging CEO, in an emerging market, dominating market share, upfront and recurring revenues on all products, repeat and scaled up orders.

3/2/21, 01:17 AM;;0;2;"Sell put-call strategy:  
 
I took $AAPL historical data since 2012 and asked how much its price has changed after 1 day, 5 days, 10 days, and 15 days. The charts show the distribution of fractional changes after N days (N ‚àà {1, 5, 10, 15}). Then I said ok, let's imagine I want to sell Put (Call) options 7% (8%) below (above) the market's price on Monday before it gets expired. Then I ask what fraction of my puts (calls) are not assigned after 5 days -- assuming I would not sell or roll them. It turns out historically only 3% of them could have been assigned (the numbers in the blue and purple text boxes).   
 
If on Mondy of every week I sell put and call options on average over yea 3% of time times I have to buy them or sell them, Put and Call assignments almost cancel one another over time, after many years I will only collect premiums and the difference between put/call buy/sells (which is positive).

3/1/21, 10:13 PM;;0;3;$AAPL How did that trade work on the 24th?  Apple is up 4.3% from my exit price, but my #Bitcoin is up more, 10.2% since my add on Sunday.  My $FIX buy on 2-26 is +9.6%.  AAPL can bounce (5.5% today), but my sense was there were better choices.  The stock should not have been in a strong down trend if things are going perfectly with the 5G thesis.  Could be wrong, but I acted on it.  I also, as many do, own plenty of Apple shares indirectly in SPYs and QQQs.  Extra exposure in a weaker stock is not on the menu for me.  Apple is lagging the SPX by about 13.5% off the AAPL ATH.  Love the company, but there are too many strong stocks in this market to not decrease exposure to those with relative underperformance.  IMO.
3/1/21, 10:13 PM;;0;4;$AAPL this is the first day in over a month that Apple hasn‚Äôt ended in the red. Weird to see it, like watching a goat walk on its hind legs and speak in tongues. My call option is now only slightly less worthless ü•¥

3/1/21, 1:45 PM
March 1, 2021 01:45 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst Color

The iPhone supercycle that kickstarted with the launch of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 12 will likely continue well into 2022, according to analysts at Wedbush Securities.

The Apple Analyst: Daniel Ives has an Outperform rating on Apple and a 12-month price target of $175, with the bull-case price target at $225.

The Apple Thesis: The next iPhone iteration, namely the iPhone 13, will likely be launched around September, Ives said. Initial Asia supply chain builds for iPhone 13 are in the 100-million-unit range compared to the firm's initial iPhone 12 reads of 80 million, he added."

Apple Will Have To Buyback $250 Billion In Stock To Become Cash Neutral

During Apple‚Äôs earnings conference call on February1,2018,Luca Maestri,the company‚Äôs CFO,stated that due to changes in the tax laws,Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company.Our current net cash position is $163 billion.And given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash,we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time.

(03)years Apple‚Äôs net cash position has essentially been halved while it has bought back 9.4 billion split-adjusted shares or 35% of them.Using the estimates below it should take Apple another three years and $250 billion to get to a neutral cash position.

* Current net cash position,fiscal 2020:$79 billion
* Estimated free cash flow per year:$70 billion
* Dividend payments per year:$14 billion
* Net increase in cash per year:$56 billion

""Selling your winners and holding your losers is like cutting the flowers and watering the weeds"" - Peter Lynch 

 Look at Tuesday & Friday. Did your stocks bounce? Did your losers  show some sign of life? I bring this up cause I can tell you now I believe we have entered a time of some extreme volatility. I'm not speaking of the VIX. I've seen mkts go straight down and the VIX go right down with it. I'm talking about a lot of headfakes - in both directions. I think it's prudent to reassess what your holding. Hope is not a good trading strategy. 

In Friday's post, and again in my post this morning (SEE BELOW), I mentioned that there were a lot of reasons the mkt should break lower to 3690/3710 But .. my caution is the mkt tends to try and catch the most offsides. I also mentioned get ready for fireworks, a 30 handle move or more is coming Monday in either direction. As of this writing, we are up .. 30 handles. Buckle up. ‚úå"

I am completely fine with this analogy.

Shopify as an ""OS"" for e-commerce is not only a meaningless buzzword but doesn't even make any sense in the context of their technology stack. It's like saying $WMT is a ""Retail OS"", a better word to use would be ecosystem if anything.

Although even that would be more of a buzzword than accurate, because it similarly implies a difficult barrier to entry due to growing reliance (i.e $AAPL Ecosystem), which Shopify doesn't have. At least it's more meaningful than calling it an OS.

So, there is very little chance that last week's mess will be duplicated and a pretty good chance that there will be some rebound.

A few ticks higher won't kill the mkt, it's the rapid spikes to worry about. We closed right at support, and while I have projected more pain ahead, perhaps to the 3690-3710 area, bulls still have a chance. Why? Cause of the way the mkt closed and the overall negative sentiment. Factor in the weakness in my two sentiment indicators  - TSLA and Bitcoin, and to me the next leg sets up for more downside. Which leads me to something I've mentioned many times, the mkt likes to catch the majority offsides. If we hold lows of last week, I'd expect a moderate bounce. On the upside I think we need to break above 3850 to regain momentum. Friday I mentioned we will have ""fireworks"" on Monday. And that we will see 30 handles or more in one direction or the other. I expect that to occur. Remember - be nimble, limited losses, and have patience. I'll be back tonight with an earnings play or two ‚úå"

As many expectFed to come out this week with messaging  stabilizing inflation expectations after last week's yield surge and nearly failed 7yr auction on Thursday, it's hard to imagine how they are going to pull all of this off. I continue to think there will be some near term abatement in equity market concerns and rotation out of long duration assets like big tech names, coupled with lots of new money pumping into the system that is unlikely to be headed into just things like regional banks and utilities. 

However, this imbalance is probably temporary. Supply side forecast of stimulus plus Fed balance sheet reduction is only a medium term issue. Yield growth abatement likely for now, allowing rebound in big names like $AMZN, $AAPL, $FB, etc but later this year  inflation expectations will come. So short term bullish, long term cautious.

Look at the 5 year chart of AAPL...last year it rallied like never before...
Just because big money moved out of the covid hit stocks and put the monwy into stocks like AAPL, AMD, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG just to avoid massive losses...
Now all that money is being pulled out...and apple has split the stock and now it has 18 billion float which no one cared about it...so it is not a surprising move if everyone is dumping this shit...
Also, due to the Gamestop issue, lot of hedge funds had to sell stocks like AAPL, AMD and other tech to have liquid cash to earn back their losses...
Now the problem is they have to buy back these shares at low prices...hence they are shorting heavily with all reasons....and they will buy back at say 85$...and then ride it up...."

they have no internal studios with costly workforces so they have gross margins about 80%. this is much better then a lot of their competitors.

they are debt free, so they can make their business 100% flexible. the mobile gaming business has improved , and the licensing business will improve a lot more when the covid restrictions become less. just in this year, there are 4 new mobile games in soft-launch. 

every euro and dollar they are making, they can invest in all these projects. innovative projects : blockchain gaming is the future. people want to own unique nfts. they want to own unique currencies like the atari token.

the atari vcs is a gift to all the atari fans. they praise the brand.

Have a gameplan. The people who have gameplans never say ""it's manipulation"", or blame shorts, or call other traders stupid for not buying, or blame algos, etc. They don't need to. They have a gameplan. And if it doesn't work, they move on to their next one. And one very important note. And I can't mention this enough ... take losses. For God's sake, learn to take losses. People are holding on to the most speculative SPACs like RMO, THCB, HYLN, etc. Junk. They are broken. You should set a mental limit and move on. 7.5 out of my 10 trades are profitable.

During his post merger news release interview with CNBC, Peter Rawlinson stated:
‚ÄúWe are attracting the bluest of blue chip companies‚Äù
Now I don‚Äôt know about you, but to me, there‚Äôs only one company that I‚Äôd label as bluest of blue chip...

That company has recently announced their entry in the EV market.
That company has also expressed interest in partnering with an existing EV manufacturer.
And that company already has a connection to Lucid because of a previous employee now working on the Lucid board of directors.

Just imagine...

$AAPL & Lucid ü§Ø

Last point;

So I don‚Äôt think Lucid is a $TSLA killer on their own, but with Apple behind them? Oh boy.

And remember how after Apple‚Äôs EV announcement Elon was quick to throw it in Tim‚Äôs face that years ago Apple turned him down?

So all I‚Äôm saying is, Apple wants to be the leader in everything, Lucid has the leading EV tech and factories by 2024 and both Tim and Peter want to surpass Tesla.

On Wednesday I mentioned I was buying GME  in AHrs at $84, it went to $200. I also mentioned I was buying $UVXY at $8.3, it exploded the next day up 30% . I also mentioned I would buy ZS for an earnings play, it popped $28 today. And that I would buy FTCH first thing this morning off an outstanding earnings report  - which the street misinterpreted.

And while I've been pretty vocal that I do believe there is more pain ahead, and a visit to my 3690-3710 level, a bounce off this level would make me rethink that thesis. That nasty close was ugly. And if you spent the day in a stock like AAPL, which dropped $3 in last few minutes, it felt pretty painful and probably very defeating.

2/26/21, 08:55 PM;;1;1;"US drops a Trump admin demand in global corporate-tax negotiations, removing one obstacle to an agreement on adapting the tax system to the digital economy.

Treasury Sec Yellen said that the US would no longer insist on a ""safe harbor"" under which some elements of the tax rules would be optional. The idea, proposed in late 2019 by her predecessor, Mnuchin, drew objections from European counterparts, though talks on how it would work never advanced.

Ms. Yellen said the US would continue to engage on both parts of the tax project being led by the OECD: a push to redefine where corporate income is taxed & a parallel effort to impose minimum taxes.

Corp profits are taxed where value is created, not where customers are located. Negotiators have sought to give countries where international co.s operate more power to tax them. In the absence of a deal, some have imposed digital-service taxes that are levies on the co.s' revs from those jurisdictions.

This is healthy and normal, like it or not. It will pass. The entire market was unrealistically green and practically parabolic for way too long. It is funny and sad at the same time that during the past few months many new young investors have joined under the assumption that the market is always green. Unfortunately for a lot of these kids, they invested way more than is smart or practical and now they will pay the price, because they probably need that money to pay rent or buy weed. For the rest of us, time to take a break from constantly staring at the screen, and/or use this time as a fantastic buying opportunity, and then sit back, relax and wait. The world is not ending. Spend some time with your family or friends! Focus on work and your health and well-being. There‚Äôs more to life than investing, enjoy the ride!

2/26/21, 05:02 AM;Bullish;4;3;"The saga of the so called ""meme stocks"" will continue, personally I believe this is a free market, so no stock should be labeled as a ""meme stock"".  A lot of calls went quickly in the money today then some stocks halted. Market makers that need to cover those options probably got exposed to risk. With the move up after hours, it suggests there were enough shares for sale to cover the calls. Market makers will be actively looking to accumulate big blocks of shares. Every time shares go higher, more shares need to be bought.Fore one stock there are so many $800 calls that I‚Äôm not sure there would be enough shares available. The interactive broker founder saying in late January that 200 million shares would need to be bought with only 50 million available would cause the stock to go into the thousands. I think we‚Äôre looking at the same situation only this round there‚Äôs more diamond hands, Robinhood is better capitalized, and more people moved to better brokers.

2/26/21, 04:47 AM;;26;37;$SPY $TSLA $UVXY $AAPL $MP Flashback Friday ... a year ago I was warning my followers to exit the mkt while we were trading near all-time highs.  (SEE BELOW) Those who followed me back then remember me recommending TVIX at $38 (which eventually went to $999). My call yesterday on buying UVXY at $8.3 is not comparable to today. Nor do I think the mkt is going to crash by any means. But there were so many young traders that got wiped out. They had never seen a sharp correction let alone a bear mkt. All they knew was anything they buy will go higher. Fast forward today and I see that same mentality. New investors/traders just keep holding broken stocks. Keep believing pie in the sky outlooks by company CEOs. Keep piling into crappy names - many of which  are new SPACs. No, we aren't going to crash. But if you bought STPK at $51 and tomorrow it trades down to $28, it's going to feel like a crash. My guess is more pain tomorrow. So don't get too excited with tonight's jump in futures. ‚úå

2/26/21, 12:08 AM;Bullish;0;3;$AAPL $NUGT $DIS Strong sustainable recovery is right around the corner and prices will rise as demand comes roaring back. In this type of environment, bond yields should be higher regardless of whether the Fed raises interest rates. Currencies are particularly sensitive to interest rates, which explains why the U.S. dollar had such a significant reaction to the 10% spike. The same is true for stocks.
