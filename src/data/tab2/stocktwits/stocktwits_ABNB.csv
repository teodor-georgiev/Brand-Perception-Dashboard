4/9/21, 10:27 PM;Bullish;4;3;"$ABNB not the same as other tech stocks which had years of r&d, consolidated state, good guidance, and a balance of retail and institutional investors. 
This stock mostly has investors who bought in at initial price offering under $70, and holding on to high profits. In a flip of a button this could go all wrong if you are buying calls and puts. However I do believe in the potential. This could go way above $200 long term if you buy stocks and hold it long term. Current state is a HOLD for a reason. And that hold wont take much time to SELL when needed to consolidate! 

Pls, dont make stupid comments. Quote some facts so I can learn if there is any bullish aspects to it.

$ABNB - Another great play looking to breakout soon on the daily. We could see it go above $200 once again. Watch for CALLS over $190 & for PUTS below $190.
$TWTR - Looking to break the downtrend & push over $70 + soon. ER this month. Team loaded the swing CALLS already. She's about to see ATH soon before ER imo.
$ROKU - Strong uptrend all day today. Looking for continuation tomorrow if she holds above $363. This one is way undervalued right now. Watch it break $400 before EOM.
$PLTR - Great dip buying opportunity here. Demo day next week. Easy money to be made especially on  ITM Swing CALLS. We could see her break $30 by eom if the momentum picks up well.

Why are people going to go to a certain spot next to a highway to sleep when they can go exactly where they want to be in a city? Anyone can offer their place. Your Air B&B will be so cozy. I was converted watching this guys Japanese blog and he got a little house overlooking a river and close to exactly the shoes he was looking to purchase.

Its so powerful to have that exact location you want in the hippest and most attractive spots in town.

The synergies would something like $UBER could be interesting. You get someone to take you to the house you are sleeping in in the same app. Have UBER take you anywhere. But of course you can do that anyway. So I am just saying why I am in right now. I can see a PT of 1000 by 2030 for sure, seeing hundreds of millions of people offering this service in the future. Might be crazy but could happen.

I was able to buy this in IPO and have watched it easily get to over $200 during pandemic.  Now that US is opening up, we are good to go.

Im long big here , see attached. Not suggesting that
However , lockup is over and insider selling should subside. 
Looks like possible double bottom here forming and this is about as low as you can buy in the public markets since ipo

Valuation is very high but this will be a long term winner and deserves consideration as a small core position for long term growth 
In all account around here 

My other main point for posting is on ipo's , never fomo ipo day or on thin float pre lockup rallies, it's a terrible idea 
Out of favor, post lockup is when I seem To have the most success 

I want $ABNB and $AI but I'm not touching either until post lockup , period

If u don't have snow, it's a good time to take a look and see if it's a fit

Old Post- The Viking's first idea is 
$ABNB 

. It's not a typical Viking recommendation as it is not a penny stock. Viking doesn't know the Price targets of big brokerages and Viking doesn't care because they play catch-up. What the Viking knows is that Air BNB has a 5.0% market share of a 2 trillion hotel and hospitality market. What the Viking knows is that they don't have to spend on advertising like hotels and booking websites. What the Viking knows is that Air BnB does not have a same class competitor. At 200 it might seem expensive but if they increase their market shares to 10% which i think they will do, the price target should be 700. $CURI $MWK"

There are too many bubbles in the market right now. This giant bubble need to be busted. It‚Äôs hard to believe that it is $101 billion market cap with $623 million revenue compared to  Northrop Grumman $50 billion in market cap with $36.79 billion in revenue. One makes stealth aircrafts and real high tech stuffs compared to the other one with only one product which has spying scandal and a lot of competitors. 

Remember market will have more corrections in the next few months, and so far more than 21% of U.S population have been vaccinated plus more new vaccines approved every 2-3 months.

Yes, there are a lot of people will still remain working at home, but a lot will com back offices, kids need go back schools, and even patients need to see doctors. I start to see some traffic jams in my area. There are no more room to grow for this company 

P/s: even though its market cap is around $30 billion($100/share), it still looks overvalued

3/14/21, 03:00 PM;Bullish;2;0;$ABNB   ABNB made the CNBC  disruptor's 50 list last year.    August 2020 booking were off the charts in a Coronavirus pandemic.   I own 50 shares and hope to add again, but waiting for lagers to rise to exit makes this tense for adding.   GLTA
3/14/21, 12:59 PM;Bullish;0;8;$ABNB I picked up 100 shares at $146 the day it opened to the public because I used Airbnb repeatedly and knew that they had a quality user experience/model. I totally ignored the fact that the IPO was set for around $65, I believed that this number was way underpriced and it appears I beat the first round of useless analysts hands down. While the stock briefly dipped below my entry, it has picked up ever since and I haven‚Äôt regretted my decision. I just added another 50 positions around $190 and another 30 at $204 this past week because I have a feeling that this probably won‚Äôt go down too much lower with spring coming, places opening up, and pent up demand. Add to this the recent performance it has shown, Robinhooders and other investors will be flocking to this very soon. Yes, it is a possibility that it could hit the $180s again but then again there‚Äôs the possibility it runs up to $240 quickly and that $200 becomes the new support.

3/13/21, 02:21 PM;Bullish;0;1;$ABNB here‚Äôs a crap site you all know called ‚ÄúInvestorobserver.‚Äù they gave Airbnb a rank of 30 out of 100, but look more closely. They‚Äôre ‚Äúchiefly‚Äù weighing NOTHING from the historical record against Airbnb lol. It appears that InvestorObserver needs to drastically change their algorithms because this is what happens whenever you heavily factor in no data because a company is brand new on the stock market. Why do we even trust this so called analyst website at all???
3/13/21, 02:15 PM;Bullish;3;1;$ABNB look at how incredibly STUPID this article is that has just shown up on Stocktwits‚Äô news feed. Zolmax (which I never heard of) compares Match (yes match dot com) to Airbnb. I suppose they think it‚Äôs an opening play. This is like comparing a Television company to a Grocery Store Chain. One has nothing to do with the other at all. Then they say to buy match dot com while even noting ‚ÄúN/A‚Äù when it comes to Airbnb‚Äôs technical history which doesn‚Äôt exist because it just IPO‚Äôd (No history on the stock market.) now can you see how these ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù want you to take money out of your stock a d for you to put it into their pockets? Such a stupid comparison...
3/13/21, 02:14 PM;;1;3;$ABNB $TSLA was a first mover in its space and disruptive at the time. AirBnB is only just starting and should get the benefit of both being a tech company and reopening company, The company not only will continue to grow its bookings, diversify its rev streams (organically & through acquisitions) but also has a large set of data worth a fortune. Remember unlike hotels, Airbnb has far less capex, minimum cost and doesn‚Äôt need huge capital. So when people try to compare fundamentals of ABNB with other hotels there is no comparison. If you had the chance to buy $GOOG, TSLA, $AMZN, $MSFT, AAPL,  FB back when they IPOd you would have alot more money. Owning ABNB is like when you could have bought the ipos mentioned in the aforementioned sentence when they first went public imo. There will be fluctuations of course but this company will be a monster in the years to come
3/13/21, 02:06 PM;Bullish;0;0;$ABNB the main reason why Airbnb has  some conservative analyst ratings is because it has a historical technical score of 0. Which simply means, ‚Äúthis is a brand new stock and we don‚Äôt have an official record to base its value on.‚Äù So simply put, ignore what the so-called experts have to say if they‚Äôre weighting a ranking while factoring in absolutely nothing Because they have nothing to base  something on.
3/13/21, 01:09 PM;Bullish;1;2;$ABNB gotta kinda laugh but this is also sad. The initial ipo valuation was valued at $68 and inside hosts were able to secure a maximum of 200 shares. One host was on the news because once the company was actually available to the public at around $150, he sold all of his shares snd said he was going to Vegas... he pocketed $30k. All I could think was ‚Äúwhat an idiot.‚Äù If he had just waited two months, he would‚Äôve pocketed an additional $10k. In a few weeks he might have an additional $20k if this hits $300/share which it could easily do. Not to mention the 33% the government will shave off from the Capital Gains Taxes, he really ended up with only approx. $20k then probably blew it all on Craps or Roulette... please Don‚Äôt be that guy.

Much better in an inflationary environment to wipe out $2B of equity obligations and high interest debnt in favor of low coupon rates in the face of a devaluing dollar.

they are using cash raised from IPO and this bond to repay their debts and obligations. FCF and net income should go through the roof in subsequent quarters. Imagine the loans they were managing pre-IPO with no reported revenues. Must've been in the 15% range pre-IPO. 
 
 Hopefully they can secure good 4-5% bond yields. This company will have such low operating costs in the future; they don't need marketing; just tech support and infrastructure build. They're definitely doing this ahead of the rise in 10Y T-rates rises."

""Airbnb intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the cost of entering into the capped call transactions described below. Airbnb intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds, together with its existing cash, to repay indebtedness."" 
 
They are essentially refinancing their expensive debt and buying up call options at today's rates. 
 
They probably had 10% debt but can now probably offer 3% debt to the private markets because they have been shown to produce revenues.  
 
It is REALLY BULLISH both for how the management views future stock prices (they don't want to pay out call options in the future) and REALLY BULLISH for revenues due to lower interest payments on existing debt."

There are too many bubbles in the market right now. This giant bubble need to be busted. It‚Äôs hard to believe that it is $120 billion market cap with $623 million revenue compared to  Northrop Grumman $49 billion in market cap with $36.79 billion in revenue. One makes stealth aircrafts and real high tech stuffs compared to the other one with only one product which has spying scandal and a lot of competitors. 

Remember market will have more corrections in the next few months, and so far more than 15% of U.S population have been vaccinated plus more new vaccines approved every 2-3 months.

Yes, there are a lot of people will still remain working at home, but a lot will com back offices, kids need go back schools, and even patients need to see doctors. I start to see some traffic jams in my area. There are no more room to grow for this company 

P/s: even though its market cap is around $30 billion($100/share), it still looks overvalued

Airbnb $ABNB has a market cap of $120B on just $3B revenues in the middle of a pandemic where almost no one is travelling.

Vaxart has a current market cap of $750M. They are contracted to produce a minimum of 1B Covid-19 vaccine pills yearly with a probable starting revenue of $5B or more. This, in the midst of a Covid-19 pandemic, where they have created the only major vaccine planned in advance to defeat all mutated strains of the virus. 
 
A market cap of just $60B (Half of AirBNB, but on 2x revenues) will take Vaxart's share price from $7 per share to $600 per share."

Sure, I get the overall rate concern story affecting all ""long duration"" high multiple tickers. But AMZN compared to many has a much shorter duration/lower multiple. Look for example at $ABNB or $TSLA. Multiples way higher, duration much longer, and cash flow profile much less certain. Yet both have responded off lows and held up better than AMZN. Meanwhile,  AMZN is not trading at a 22% discount to the median price target. Q1 numbers for $TSLA are highly uncertain with a fair number of negative possibilities floating around. Q1 numbers for AMZN are going to be unbelievably high. So, yes the 10 year is at 1.4%, but there is something else going on here that is confusing..."

2/23/21, 08:27 AM;Bullish;1;11;"üö® WATCH LIST FOR TOMORROW PART 2 üö® :

$TSLA - Has a little more downtrend to see as market is showing a heavy sell off, especially in EV sector. Expecting a bounce soon but could play PUTS for short term/scalps before we see the trend change.
$CCIV - Buy the rumor, sell the news type of move could happen tomorrow. Short term play on PUTS could print nice. However after the merger she could go up big time.
$LUV - Plenty of unusual CALL ACTIVITIES & Darkpool buys detected. Looking for continuation of uptrend tomorrow. Easy money here.
$ABNB - Will be looking to load the dips tomorrow to play the ER hype. She can go $20 - $30 up in a single day if the hype & uptrend stays strong.
$ZM - ER coming up, amazing dip buying opportunity here. Play the hype, sell before ER. Under $400 is an amazing dip to load. Will be posting CALLS tomorrow if I see good potential for upcoming days. Stay tuned.

2/23/21, 07:49 AM;Bullish;0;0;"$ISRG Long-term, multi-year winner.  However, I've been adding calls as a covid-recovery play here.

I did NOT think it would give up the 55 ema so easily.  That's weak.  IV below HV means calls are well-priced.  A number of experts (at JPM, Johns Hopkins, etc.) think we'll be ""effectively vaccinated"" against Covid by April/May.  

If that's the case, this and $ABNB are fantastic recovery plays.  Chart is weak here -- BUT they can declare a dividend at any time OR split the stock to provide support.  

No concerns.  None at all.  But yes, surprised."

$ABNB
. It's not a typical Viking recommendation as it is not a penny stock. Viking doesn't know the Price targets of big brokerages and Viking doesn't care because they play catch-up. What the Viking knows is that Air BNB has a 5.0% market share of a 2 trillion hotel and hospitality market. What the Viking knows is that they don't have to spend on advertising like hotels and booking websites. What the Viking knows is that Air BnB does not have a same class competitor. At 200 it might seem expensive but if they increase their market shares to 10% which i think they will do, the price target should be 700."

2/12/21, 12:47 PM;;2;8;"$CLOV watched the Hope King and Emily Evans youtube clip. Few personal thoughts: 
 
1. King doesn‚Äôt know the difference between SEC and DOJ. There was never a SEC probe before Hindenburg report.  
 
2. Evans herself said that the Hindenburg report including the DOJ inquiry part is weak. She then insinuates that issues can come from up-selling. In that case the whole health care space is doomed. 
 
3. Her main argument is that a bunch of techies can‚Äòt change the heavily regulated health care space. Right at the end she then says millennials want change! She is confused in that regard as Clover is exactly trying to make the space more customer friendly to everyone including younger generations.  
 
4.  It is very clear that she has an issue against Clover, Chamath and techies. This is a baseless organised attack. 
 
The disruptors today: i.e. car company ($TSLA), accommodation provider ($ABNB) or taxi company ($UBER) came from techies not a petrol head, hotelier or taxi driver."

Working inside the company‚Äôs trust and safety unit, the employees comb through Facebook, Twitter and far-right online forums and track where rallies are planned. Often the team creates dummy accounts on Facebook, known as ‚Äúsock puppet‚Äù accounts, to monitor customers publicly embracing propaganda that could encourage violence.

 How will it affect ABNB not at all, the people doing ABNB don't stay at mainstream hotels, they had money pre/during  panicdemic, and will have money post panicdemic.

  What happens over the next 3-6 months depends on how long the panicdemic will be used as a political weapon......if Hidin/Lyin China Joe Biden shuts down air travel completely, I'm thinking that's a bad thing.
  Carbon taxation on gasoline, aircraft fuel, natural gas, heating oil, your farts, its coming and it will be bad, real bad..... this economy will be wreaked over the next four years.... but hey we'll all feel better about ourselves!"

$SNOW - Shot up with an absolutely bullish PR and came back down due to the market sell off. The daily chart looks really promising here. She can spike back over $310 - $320 soon. Good opportunity for scalps here.
$GME - Shorters / Bears couldn't do much on this one, watch for possible continuation to $45 + here.
$ABNB - Alerted this one yesterday & before. Congrats if you caught my alert & got in. She could be ready to gap up over $200.
$ZM - With more lock down news coming & S&P 500 rumors, she lost her brakes and heading over $400. Don't miss the train. We got plenty of dips to load and I kept alerting you all. Scalp it if you don't want to risk naked calls.

Why Airbnb Stock Could Soar in 2021

fool.com/investing/2021/01/...

""Australia offers one example. The country went into lockdown last summer -- their winter -- and emerged from it in September. Since then, the country has been experiencing only about 20 coronavirus cases a day. In December, traffic to Airbnb's Australian site reached 7.85 million visits, or double what it was in August. Trends are similar in hotels, with demand for accommodations up 20%-30% over the last three months, according to Google data. 

A number of travel operators have reported surges in reservations for this summer, especially for ""bucket list"" trips to places like Machu Picchu and the Galapagos Islands, which are already sold out in 2021."""

1/12/21, 01:11 AM;Bullish;0;1;"$ABNB Dear investors, you may want to check out Astro Aerospace Ltd $ASDN, a pre-revenue eVTOL passenger drone company. Its drone is capable of manned and unmanned flights. Their prototype performed Transport Canada SFOC approved test flights. They are also working on v. 2.0, the modular multiplatform ALTA drone with swappable pods. 
$ASDN website, see:
flyastro.com/
This is a highly speculative play, but they are on the upswing. In 2018, after the OTC merger with shell company their stock was above $3, but as a pre-revenue, they fell out of popularity. The SP is slowly buy surely  climbing up now, from $0.04 to $0.20 today. Once SP reaches above $1-$2 (and I think they will soon), they will attract  serious investors or become attractive take over target. All they really need is more capital.  But with fomo currently building up and resulting SP appreciation, this may soon be a non-issue.

12/31/20, 07:41 AM;Bullish;10;16;"$RMO just to explain how the bear game work:

- institutions have bought into the stock early (somewhere between 10 and 20). Institutions won't sell in the near term as they usually hold long unless they specialize in short.

- bears, knowing that, know that their effect will be pronounced as the major investors are already in. So they short

- it then gets to a point where it hits your stoploss and from that point the snowball effect kicks in and more frantic loose hands start to sell.

The reality is, this company is already profitable before they became public. They're very generous with their valuation (unlike $ABNB and $DOOR). So it's better for the retail investor in that sense. You just have to hold strong. That's all what I can tell you"

This isn‚Äôt just a vacation platform, more and more real estate investors are switching from a traditional landlord-tenant business model to a short term rental one with Airbnb. With the right properties, there‚Äôs just a lot higher profit margins in short term rentals. You can google what I‚Äôm saying. Plus with the real estate market being more saturated right now than ever with record low interest rates, I expect the next quarterly earnings to surprise us. My point - This stock has the potential to completely transform the housing industry.

12/27/20, 05:12 PM;Bullish;5;22;$XL Citron's $60 PT may be conservative. The $100 PT issued by top analyst Luke Lango is more accurate (link below). Why? Consider that traditional IPOs hype stocks up so that they open fully valued on day one of the IPO. SPACs are different. A SPAC merger gets completed with little to no hype, relative to the traditional IPO. If XL had come public the traditional IPO route, then the hype would have opened the price of XL stock above $100 on day one. If you doubt this statement, then please consider the valuations assigned for traditional IPOs like $DASH and $ABNB. Unlike the overvaluation of traditional IPOs, stocks like XL come to market dramatically undervalued in the SPAC process. The retail market has the opportunity to ride these stocks higher to full valuation. Lango's $100 per share gives XL about the same market cap as 12B $LAZR. However, if XL were to trade to the same 40B market cap as $QS, then XL is a $280 per share stock. Bottom line: Higher! muckrack.com/lukelango3/art...

What is an industry that is incapable and would not benefit from the integration of technology? The most basic idea of economics is efficiency, match the buyer and the seller as quickly as possible with the maximum amount of profit for both parties. That system will prevail. So what is the difference with real estate? You‚Äôre telling me that you believe people would rather limit their potential bids to a singular agent at their local Remax vs an algorithmic based service that has access to all sellers/buyers and their information?

When everything does reopen that will accelerate as more will prefer to stay in an Airbnb as they‚Äôve enjoyed the experience better and cheaper with more facilities than hotels etc!

12/22/20, 07:59 PM;;0;1;$ABNB Keep chugging!! There could be a dip at the 6-month mark around the lockup dates... but by this time perhaps the vaccine will be widely distributed and the travel/accommodation market will be back on the rise?  Can take time to make that judgment call but if travel isn't back to normal by the lockup period... I'd consider watching from the sidelines and jumping in at a lower price.
