Hydrogen Is Here to Stay 
 
Plug Power is one of the biggest providers of clean hydrogen fuel cell solutions in the world. The company was founded in 1997, it went public in 2002, and currently, it has a presence all over the United States. At the moment, its major business is the powering of indoor forklifts with its hydrogen fuel cells for companies like Nike ($NKE), Whole Foods, Walmart ($WMT), Amazon ($AMZN), and others. 
 
In addition, in 2017, Plug Power delivered the first hydrogen fuel cell engines to USPS for its forklift fleet, and as a result, the company now has a 95% market share for hydrogen fuel cells in the transportation industry.

2/18/21, 12:27 AM;;0;0;$NKE structure is impulsive from the Janaury 2021 low. It is now correcting that rally and is currently in the middle/sideways zone.

While above 128.93 further extension higher is a favoured once this pullback is complete. #elliottwave #trading #stocks

2/17/21, 03:49 AM;;1;0;$NKE Currently, sneakers are all over the world. However, inconsistencies with limited sales methods and sneakers made from recycled materials. Air sneakers sold during the 90's fashion will become garbage, and NIKE has not taken any repairs or countermeasures. In other words, tackling environmental and racial issues seems hypocritical.so I’m judged equal,good luck

One of their segments is heavily in the merchandising area, and could put them in a similar position in the music industry to how Nike is in sports.  Of of their segments, Authentic Heroes, has patented technology that takes event-worn clothing from celebrities, extracts the fibers, and produces thousands of clothes made from the original. Recently, they signed a deal with Universal Music & Yungblud. Yungblud has millions of followers on Instagram and one of the highest fan engagements in the industry. It should be launching soon. If this interests you go check it out. Could care less what you do.

12/23/20, 03:54 PM;Bullish;0;1;"$NKE “There's no bigger name in sports footwear and apparel than Nike (NYSE:NKE). The company has displayed a knack for evolving and adapting when faced with challenges, as evidenced by the growth that it reported in its fiscal 2021 second-quarter earnings report. For the period that ended Nov. 30, revenue hit $11.2 billion, up 9% year over year, while net income grew 12% to reach $1.3 billion.
Nike had to temporarily shut the bulk of its stores because of the coronavirus pandemic in the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2020, which ended May 31. Within two quarters, Nike has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround and posted growth, once again, showcasing the resilience of the brand and the company's business model.

Nike has shown itself to be a leader in harnessing the power of technology to connect with customers and drive sales, while its brand strength will allow it to grow and maintain its leadership for many years to come."

12/22/20, 04:28 PM;;1;1;"NHL & NHLPA announced the formalized plans for the 2020-21 season beginning on Jan 13.

Training camps will begin on Jan. 3, though the seven teams that did not qualify for the 2020 postseason are allowed to open camp on Dec. 31. Teams are able to invite 36 skaters and an unlimited number of goalies to camp.

A realignment of divisions was necessitated by the Canadian border remaining closed to nonessential business. Therefore, all Canadian teams (Ottawa Senators, Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Winnipeg Jets, Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, Vancouver Canucks) will be in the North division aka #WeTheNorth Division.

For the1st time, NHL teams will be able to put ads on the sides of players' helmets & the league will sign off on the ad choices 

The Stanley Cup should be awarded around mid-July.

As of 2020, the NHL is the only one of the 4 major professional American sports leagues whose uniforms are not outfitted by $NKE. Current deal w/ Adidas ends in 2024.

Overall, it will be important to see if the rebound seen in Q1 was more about pent up demand and perhaps pulling sales from Q2, or if Nike is seeing a genuine and durable upswing in results. Also, AugQ may have benefitted from warm summer months, but the weather starts to turn colder in NovQ, so we'll see if the recovery continued. Finally, Nike's results should help to set expectations for upcoming earnings reports from retailers/sporting goods stores: $DKS, $HIBB, $FL, SKX, $UAA."

 NKE reports earnings on December 18th after market close. EPS forecasts are $ 0.61 down from the reported $ 0.7 last quarter. With strong demand for online sales and a recent surge in the stock's price to a new 140.45 ATH, look for NKE to surge in the lead up to earnings. The strength of the brand's international presence could drive a significant earnings beat this quarter.

The temporary limits are a sign that UPS is metering the flow of packages into its network to preserve its performance during one of the busiest shipping weeks of the year. 

UPS will pick up packages from customers whose demand exceeds allocated space once more capacity becomes available. Shipping levels tend to jump the week after Thanksgiving, then slip a bit until another big increase in the week before Christmas.

NRF est'd that online shopping jumped 44% over a recent five-day stretch that included Black Friday & Cyber Monday.

Earlier this year, delivery co.s were overwhelmed as extra trailers full of parcels arrived at some facilities & waited to be unloaded due to the unexpected surge in e-commerce & employee absences due to COVID.

ShipMatrix ests a surplus of as many as 7M daily packages b/n Thanksgiving & Christmas."

11/2/20, 02:58 PM;Bullish;0;0;"$NKE $QCOM 

NKE- didn’t held the previous support at 130 thus now it fell below the trendline support. This is a critical level for nike as it can break down more or continue the pattern in the ascending pattern. I recommend to play a hedge on the weekly and  a long call a month out if you want to play this. It is a bit risky and the market is very volatile. Thus, monitor carefully but I believe sales will be great with black Friday and Christmas coming for their Q1 results. Long term this can see 130-140 again. 

QCOM – Trading above the trendline support and bold well during the market sell off. Double support around 120 and a potential bounce play back to 125+ if the sma resistance is broken. Look for a short term swing for this as the market settles. 

Follow for  morning opinions"
11/2/20, 02:48 PM;;0;0;For group 3 this week, we are still looking for $SPY to reach lower to equal leg, and some other names also that have extreme areas below the Sep low.  $NKE has already reached the extreme area where buyers may enter for a bounce in 3 swing at least.  We do not favour selling these names right now, nor tech names like $FB, AMZN, $AAPL, $TSLA.  Although they can head lower, the right side on longer time frames is bullish. #Elliottwave #Trading #Stocks #USelection

If u didn't listen to Apple's conference call and do ur DD and u think another 4 years of this guy with his incomplete phase 3 China plan is the long term solution, then u really truly have no idea what your doing and need to stay away from China-dependent stocks such as Apple and Nike, not to mention the entire market.

It's clear that China and US are both essential to one another.  Biden is the only answer at this point.  The street really is sending a message that they want Trump out.  It's become so difficult to make money in this Trump economy as of late when Fed is no longer pumping in money & no one jumping in b/c there's no money.  Situation is really over his head and tho he's fun to watch at rallies, at end of the day i could care less.  I want to grow my money.  Not laugh at 5 second ""sleepy joe"" comedy show jokes.

Bearish short term until Trump is done.  Bullish long term until Biden cleans up mess.  Can't wait to make the stock market again!!"

Not that much into politics, but can't wait for a Biden win.  This past couple of months with the current administration and an incomplete China phase trade deal is just not working out.  It was cute in the beginning, but obviously right now seems lost.  I'd rather prefer a slow predictable mostly green going up market than this herky jerky volatile unpredictable mostly red going down market as of late.  We need our foreign investors and corporations to come back, the same ones that Trump has alienated from his macho man antics.

Biden's 43% capital gains tax proposal (if he implements it) only affects Americans with more than 1 million income.  This would only temporarily slow the rally.

10/22/20, 03:19 PM;Bullish;0;1;"$JD $MTCH $NKE $SE 
JD- creating the perfect cup and handle pattern right now. Over 83 consolidation and I can see this breaking out to 84-85 dollars again. Mid term target is 88-90 dollar handle breakout. My favorite play still. 

MTCH- interesting pattern as it could retest 115 levels or continues the u shape upward trend to 120. With a break of 120 it can try to test the 52 week. I would play a few weeks out if you are swinging but this is a possible good setup if you play near earnings. 

NKE- trading along the sma support and im liking the pattern for now. If it can break above 130 and consolidate I see a breakout from the 52 week high and 134 -135 near term and a potential gap play to 138-140 mid term. 

SE- has been trading along the sma support where 160 is the strong level support with trendline support as well. As long the ascending wedge pattern isnt broken. SE can see new highs in the midterm near many gaming releases. Expect to see 180 gap trend resistance."

Rare that i agree with Cramer, but he's spot on about this.  If there's a blue wave in November, good chance these stocks all shoot up.  Agreed.

10/19/20, 03:23 PM;Bullish;0;1;"$NIO $NKE $PG 

NIO- has been exploding lately and I believe the max downside would be 25 range. . I would monitor the pull back near the 25-26 range. However, the 27 range can be a possible bounce play on a dip. If this breaks 30$ before a pull back then it can gap up nicely. 

NKE- lovely pattern and still trading near the sma 20 support in the ascending wedge pattern. I can see this a good potential bounce play off sma support and trending upward to the trendline resistance and gap fill. I can see this 130-134$ in the near term and mid term $140 gap fill is possible. 

PG- close to the breakout and it tested the trendline resistance at 145. If you are wanting to play for the breakout you can, as it can gap to 150. However, earning reports are near for this stock. I am thinking a huge er beat but I could be wrong. If this can consolidate above 145 with a nice er beat this can gap up to 150 then even 155-160 continuation."

LOW- Trading in a range. Anything under 170 then I wouldn’t play this until reaches close to the trendline support in the low 160s. However, as long it is above 170 then it can form a bullish move forward. Short term target would be $180.

MDLZ- Watch this test the 52 week high. A break of $60 can create a parabolic move to $63-65 dollars in the near term. Possibly this week. I would watch this closely as a lot of stocks like to gap up after a certain resistance. ER is a few weeks out as well. 

NKE- Im very bullish on nike as long it trades along the 125 support level. I can see nike hitting 138$ soon it may take several weeks unless there is a volume spike. Medium risk play but if there is a pull back mid  120s is the best dip buy swinging long. More risk to swing this would be 128.

Dont let these daily swings excite your bearish side because it is  a TRAP as nike has brand recognition & everyone wants it and as for the stock, MM darling and retails nibble too...

So, as long as the overall market doesn't shard, this is going up...And good luck with the market's sharding because all the liquidity created by you-know-who wont go to savings or interests but chase higher returns and will end up in the stock market and fav stocks like Nike.

NKE- reached the 129-130 pt yesterday and the market dumped at a good level 127 support. Expect to see a push above 130 this week and the consolidation levels are 124-126. Near term PT 129,130 then 132. Long term 135-138 slow push in the next month. 

PG- fell back to 139 support. I really like this play for the near term as it had potential to gap up to the 143$ trendline resistance on the ascending wedge. Earnings are coming up and these are the type of plays you like for a parabolic mover. 

GLW- an old chart play a fews week back making some moves. It is at a key level of a breakout or not. Potential short term gap up around 34.50 today if it doesn’t get rejected and 35-36 in two weeks or less. Depends if it can consolidate or bust through the 52 week high."

10/6/20, 04:14 PM;Bullish;0;7;"$DKNG Upper management is focused on creating a similar brand recognition as $NKE. 

Part of this strategy involves bringing MJ on board, among other factors such as ubiquitous marketing and proprietary, in-game betting technology (expected fall of 2021)

Right now, Draftkings is in the early stages of differentiating from FanDuel.

This is still early in the game and not too late to be on the winning team."

10/6/20, 03:17 PM;Bullish;0;3;"$COST $NKE 
COST – Looking to fill a possible gap once it breaks 365 to 368 and maybe 370. Could be a runner in the mid term to 400. If you are looking to play just remember to buy closer to the support. I personally would play a debit spread around 3660-362 or a bull put spread. Watch this closely, however it needs volume to make any significant pushes.  Dip around the 360-361, and second dip around 357-358.

NKE- still looks good for the bullish push near the consolidation range of 124-126. If the markets are good look for a push to 129-130 today. You can probably get in a dip in the low 127 maybe a flash 126."

BABA – inverted hammer forming and good bounced off the 286 region. Could consolidate around the mid 290s until it breaks the pendant. I would play a debit spread around 286   to 290. However if you are feeling risky 290 +. Bull put spread works as well. Best debit spread is 285-287.50 off support. 

JNJ- Strong support around 145 and usually bounces around 146-148. If I would to play this week possibly a bull put spread at 145 to 147 by expiration. 

NIO- Looking good I believe this could trend nicely if the ev sector continues. 23 PT then 25PT to fill the trendline gap. I would play a bullput spread off 20 to 23 or maybe a debit spread as well from 20-23. 
NKE- Seems to be trending nicely around 126 range from earnings consolidation. Second level of support around 124. Possibly can hit 130 top line resistance. If I would to play this bull put spread from 124/126 to 128/130 by expiration or a debit spread at 124-128 personally."

9/25/20, 01:38 PM;Bullish;0;1;"$NKE Nike is a Most Improved Player, but its retro sneakers are the real MVPs
Swoosh swoosh... Despite a global crisis, Nike was its own Most Improved Player last quarter. Sales slipped less than 1% compared to last year and profit actually increased. That's a big glow up from June, when Nike posted a loss and 38% sales plunge. Nike's stock is up 8% in the last week on the performance.

The OGs are the real MVPs... What fascinated us most: Nike is cashing in big on its vintage shoe styles. Whenever there's a slump, Nike can fall back on its trusty OGs. That's a major advantage that iconic brands have over newer players (no one wants Lululemon's 2001 leggings)."

9/23/20, 04:28 PM;;0;2;"$NKE For those of you who thought this was going to $150 and have no clue what you are doing, the $126-$127 range is crucial for Nike. If it holds, then this could bounce between $128 -$130. If $126 fails, then you will see a gap fill at $120.

If you are holding call options below $130 then sell now while you still have premium. If you have calls above $130, they are worthless at this point so hope & pray!"

9/23/20, 12:49 PM;Bullish;0;1;$NKE  it is clear Nike is worth more value. They have proved to survive an economic slowdown and came out of it with less competition, leaving even more market share to be captured by them. Strong brand with top of the line products, to... just do it! A lot going on in their pipeline with demand for it. Digital sales are way up to add to the revenues and earnings that they potentially can produce without it, creating a total higher value.  Direct sales are way up, which tells us they don’t need other sellers like Amazon and can do this on their own. Better consumer relations and products will come from this. Throughout geographical demand is up on their innovation and style in their drivers of health, exercise, sports, casual and they create products from these drivers in all the categories of apparel/clothing/equipment/gear/protection/footwear/accessories

Then at end of day they’re -5%. “Alright tomorrow”. NO. STOP. If you DON’T know what you’re doing, stop, ask someone, read a book, follow real traders on ST (there are plenty) who post real shit (not pump low floats), ask for help, go look at charts, learn about support & resistance, AND THEN go trade. Not sure if you knew this but your money doesn’t grow on trees. Unless you have an avocado farm 🥑. Long story short, go learn then paper trade. After 10 green trades in a row, use your real money. Remember though, the reason your paper trades were green is: paper trades lack emotion. Let go of your emotions while trading. That’s the lesson you get from paper trading.

I do have some calls of $128 strike. Right now it looks like there would be huge premium. However sad part is calls can not be sold until market opens.

And by the time market opens stock price would slide comparatively to current price as lot of profit taking happens in pre-market.

Also some people those who don't have pre-market access take profit post market open.

so strategy would be to sell calls immediately after market open.

And no big cap stock leaves gap unfilled. so it would touch  $120 at some point."

Disney had a similar earnings beat, very similar AH price action, opened with a small dip, then went parabolic for 2 minutes and jumped another 10$. Let’s say 130-135 at open tomorrow. 140-145$ strikes might be 40-100$ a pop. Nike is just as household of a name if not more than Disney. The robinhood FOMO at open might follow the same pattern with another 10$ gap up followed by a slow bleed rest of day. Securing any call below .50 a pop on the bell dip.

Media produces narratives that follow geopolitical and/or macro-economic data/events. Most of the narratives they develop arent scalable but relate to pockets of macro-picture. Election isnt scalable by itself, consumer sentiment isn't scalable by itself, North Korea conflicts arent scalable by itself, COVID19 hot spots from summer not scalable by itself, wave of foreclosures not scalable by itself, OPEC turmoil not scalable and so on. Most issues never stack together either & as such EPS tend to trend higher if not for real sales growth but also the combination of YoY buyback programs. Whether you like how EPS grows or not, the market doesn't care for your likes & dislikes. Nonetheless, much of the aforementioned trips up MOST investors, novice & experienced alike as they convince themselves that in a $18TRN economy, such issues can not only make a sizable dent in the scale, but offset the artificial EPS growth from buybacks."

NLS has a good chart forming and In a similar sector with pton. Look for a possible upward explosion. 👍

Nike is close to break their 52 week high and the sector seems hot now. Also, earning reports is coming and premium will start to rise

Hello everyone:

NIKE has had the bullish move to the upside, hitting the all the high price.

We see the price broke out of the triangle structure, and quick correction followed by the strong impulse.

As how I always approach these type of price action would be keep a close eye on whether we will get a continuation correction here on the lower time frame.

This will give me extra confluence to add in more buys.

Look for either a breakout from this channel structure, or wait for a deeper correctional structure and enter the buy.

Thank you"

8/13/20, 07:01 PM;;1;1;"In France, home to much of the world's luxury fashion industry, the government this year passed the world's first law forbidding companies from destroying unsold, usable goods. The European Union has proposed a similar ban that would cover the entire 27-nation bloc.

Brands that destroy unsold goods have sparked outrage from consumers, politicians and environmental groups.  A French government study estimated that French businesses destroyed EUR600M in unsold goods in 2014, the last year data are available. In 2018, Burberry Group PLC said it would stop destroying inventory, after disclosing that it burned GBP28.6M worth of stock in the previous fiscal year. Last year, an investigative report by the French television channel M6 found that Amazon was destroying thousands of products. The report helped prod the government to include the ban in waste-reduction legislation passed last month.

Hi everyone:

NIKE has very good price action developped that can see price gets push to the all time high area.

From the higher time frame, we see the price action had a strong bullish impulse from the downside, recovered from the Covid drop .

Now we see price has broken out of higher time frame continuation structure from the previous move up.

As always, I will wait a confirmed correction to develop here, and take the next buy move up.

Thank you"

8/5/20, 06:14 PM;Bearish;2;2;$NKE Guys this is a perfect area to buy. Near All time highs of $105. The Bottom in the last economic crisis in 2009 was $10. Don't worry Covid is just a dream. When you wake up it will be all gone. 🤯🤣 Risk vs reward people. 👍
8/5/20, 06:11 PM;Bullish;0;0;$NKE shorts are out in force as they lost most of not all of their profits all in one morning. How great is that?!?! Now their here talking Covid crap and hoping this drops. They will all get destroyed if this has back to back green day’s,  which is likely to happen. Nike has made ample changes to attract business via online so sales will no longer be hampered by any virus resurgence. Long and strong! Looking for a new 52wk high by next week.
8/5/20, 06:10 PM;;3;2;$NKE I don’t care if I missed out on gains, I’m out. I live in America and this company took a turn towards a movement I don’t support.  I don’t think investors have clearly priced in others that feel the same way.

8/5/20, 05:02 PM;Bullish;0;0;$NKE if you know, you know. People who can't afford to pay rent or bills still make sure they pick up the latest drop. All NKE needs is a market tailwind which it's now getting.
8/5/20, 04:58 PM;Bullish;0;1;$NKE congrats longs $105 likely, $110 possible
8/5/20, 04:58 PM;Bullish;1;0;$ELY seems like there is a ton of value even at the current valuation. $ELY is clearly a growing company, it’s profitable. It’s a stay at home at home play all day. Yet it’s valuation is only about 10x earnings. $2B seems too light. Does anyone have a good comp company? $NKE isn’t growing its top line and it’s valuation is ~40 x times earning... and everyone loves it. Why is $ELY valuation so low with respect to its revenue and earnings?
8/5/20, 04:57 PM;Bullish;0;0;$NKE easy call to $105 now
8/5/20, 04:57 PM;Bearish;1;1;$NKE Of all the trash getting bought up today, this is one of the most egregious.
8/5/20, 04:56 PM;Bearish;3;1;$NKE $SPY The Virus is only getting worse. Death rate at 4% Thats almost 700,000 people dead every 6 months. Any Vaccines that come out will take years before they are proven safe. Many people will lose their jobs. Nobody will be buying $200 sneakers. Especially this winter when the Virus is at its peak. If you think last earnings was bad wait.

This week, the fund flow of the stock market totally reversed back to Bearish where 4 of my Tide Indicators are short on the stock market again. This will reverse the indication last week that the fund flow of the stock market might be switching back to Bullish soon. The Tide Indicators for this week will imply that the fund flow of the stock market still remains Bearish and there is surely no reversal back to Bullish fund flow yet.

Similarly, looking on the price action of the major charts, the price action is also starting to become bearish again. I am now expecting the Bearish tide to resume again in the upcoming weeks with these double top forming in the charts. With all these indications, I will be still maintaining my Bearish tide portfolio.

I will share more in my Full Tide Indicators analysis on 27 July. Cheers 😊"

Companies are near all time highs the $SPY is Overextended, Covid-19 is spreading like wildfire, China and the US are fighting and many insiders in companies like NIKE are dumping their shares. You actually can predict the future in the Market you just have to pay attention to the clues. This is when you sell ,buy puts and go short. And hold. Thats how you swing trade. For those of you who listen you can thank me a month or so from now. Probably sooner.👍

Nike breaking up out of the descending channel.  It is to early in the day to take a trade based on current price action, but if this holds into end of day this could be a great long opportunity.  Finding support on the 1D 21 and now breaking up out of the channel.  I want to see strong buying volume as well.  If this does break up 103-104 is very possible in the next few weeks.

7/21/20, 12:34 AM;Bearish;0;1;"$NKE $SPY Trade Idea

Rejection from the top of the channel on wednesday last week has lead to some nice downside.  Today's Price action opened under the 1D 55 tested it and sold off.  This is a pretty bearish sign that Price action was rejected by the 1D 55.  With 1D RSI and stochastic's in a bearish posture I think this could potentially have more downside in its future. 

A retest of the low 90's seems very likely in the next month.

SHORT SHORT SHORT!  Nike rejected off of the top of the channel and potentially losing the 1D 21 today.  If you are looking to take a position I would wait to see if the 1D 21 does break to the downside today.  Overall this looks like this will be heading back down to the low 90's.  With RSI crossing back down I definitely would not be buying here.

Overall, as per my Tide Indicators, the fund flow of the stock market still remain more towards Bearish.

With all the bearish price action in major charts currently, I am expecting the upcoming weeks to be Bearish for the stock market with more major movement downwards. Charts wise and timing wise, I will say that it is extremely risky to go Long as Bearish tide is very likely to take over again to continue the trend down. I am looking forward to more Bearish tide movement in the stock market in the upcoming weeks to come.

All the best trading everyone and trade with the tide!"

6/28/20, 08:46 PM;;2;0;$NKE Nike is a great stock to invest in. On top of tremendous growth, they’re very affordable compared to many large name company’s, pay out hefty and ever-growing dividends, and grow at a fairly rapid pace. During Covid-19, a lot of people have been told to stay home from work or have reduced hours. This means more people have more time to workout and many have been buying Nike's shoes and active-wear as a result. All of this to say, it’s a great buy for swing traders and long-term investors alike. Bullish

Nike has some problems as the decline of sports and loss of some retail channels due to the fact that trying on shoes helps spread the virus is hurting its business.  It is also relatively overvalued."

We had been warning of this move and waiting for it to breakdown for weeks.  We continue to believe the recent rally in stocks was more about investor anticipation that the Fed would drive a price recovery and less about real earnings and revenue growth/capabilities.
 
Well, it looks like $NKE may have burst the bubble yesterday with their nearly $800m Q4 loss (their accounting runs on a different schedule than the traditional annual schedule).
 
If NIKE is reflecting this type of loss from a period of March through May, then we can expect the next quarter to be nearly the same or worse after all the riots and destruction of retail and other outlets.  And wait for the rest of the US companies to start rolling out their Q2 numbers in a few weeks."

Clearly that's not anywhere near enough to offset their brick and mortar. Lots of people aren't shopping in store anymore and only a few are going online. On top of all this it's hurting them that people who normally wouldn't shop online are. Look at the hit their taking on returns. What do you think that's from? The 75 percent increase in online sales aka the people who normally shop in store but are doing it online now. Every business that is transitioning from majority in store sales to rapid online sales increases is going to have this issue.

Right before the bell they sell all those CALLS they bought to trick you into those $105's 2 days before  (big closing red candle, check it). All along they also sold you those CALLS for premium as they know itll tank and strung you along! They are out before the bell and cash out the next morning, double cash!

6/25/20, 11:19 PM;;0;1;"$NKE Listening to the conference call and announcement of new digital initiatives. Looks like this past quarter (Q4) is the worst that Nike will have and everything will move forward (and higher) from here.

It is important to remember that, as Nike shifts from wholesale distribution to digital, both their gross & operating margins will increase. Furthermore, their ""digital marketplace"" sounds like the potential to grow into an Amazon marketplace for health & wellness. If Nike achieves this vision, then I see ~50% upside from here over the next 12-18 months. Expect to see analyst price targets in the 125-150 range tomorrow morning.

While the Q4 numbers were lousy, watch Wall Street analysts give them a pass tomorrow. I believe this will close green tomorrow in spite of AH fall.

Good luck everyone."

6/25/20, 07:02 PM;Bullish;2;2;$NKE Nike is a great stock to invest in. On top of tremendous growth, they’re very affordable compared to many large name company’s, pay out hefty and ever-growing dividends, and grow at a fairly rapid pace. During Covid-19, a lot of people have been told to stay home from work or have reduced hours. This means more people have more time to workout and many have been buying Nike's shoes and active-wear as a result. All of this to say, it’s a great buy for swing traders and long-term investors alike.

If you don’t believe these names will move their entire sectors, you’re being naive. In addition, we have $FDX on Tuesday which is a huge indicator on the economy. Now mind you, we have had more virtual, stay at home situations so perhaps an increase in shipments could offset the lack of productivity in the economy. Stay nimble, these will start to get very interesting as it will either confirm or go a giant the “V SHAPE RECOVERY THEORY” which I think is a lie. The V shape recovery happens in the market, it ain’t happening overnight in the economy.

So far, there is no change in the Bearish fund flow and the Smart money continue to have a Bearish stance on the stock market. What remains outstanding is still bearish price action in the stock market then I will start to short the stock market. 

This week, I did not notice any confirmed bearish price action yet in the major charts. Therefore, I remain Neutral (not Bearish yet) on the stock market.

I wish to reiterate that even though my Tide Indicators is pointing to a market peak in the coming short term, do stay patient and not rush into going short without a clear sign of reversal. The stock market will still continue to trend up as long as the peak is not reached yet.

I will share more about the fund flow data in the full Tide Indicators analysis which will be posted in my blog on 8 June 2020. Cheers! 😊"

The underlying message here is that breadth is weak, the market is benefitting from the current structure, but could falter due to that same structure. If these stocks falter over the coming 3-month period, which is perfectly aligned with the Q2 earnings season deliveries, the broader basket of stocks may not have enough strength to pick up the pieces. Having said that, we are forced to recognize that the historical data provided by Goepfert has never found the balance sheets with such sales and profit performances in the past and during bear markets/recessions. Recall from Friday’s State of the Market video the following: 
 
You can see in the following chart that these sectors: Information Technology, Communication Services and Health Care, now constitute over half of the S&P 500’s market cap."

5/16/20, 05:38 PM;Bearish;0;2;"$FL The things I would look for in their earnings aren’t EPS or revenue they are 

• Exposure to retail space in malls, are they paying rent, do they expect to and most importantly are they renegotiating leases with mall owners and what is the outlook 

• Online sales (their only hope) and Q1 does provide one good number it’s the increase in online sales. Did they go up 100% like Overstock? Or 19%? Big difference

• percentage of sales and margin on $NKE products. Nike has been very successfully growing overall, but growing its direct to consumer sales at phenomenal rates. Cutting out middle men is what Nike is doing. Keep in mind when they decided to sell a few shoes on amazon (later removed by Nike) Foot Lockers stock price plummeted. 

• expected sales for the Back to School season. They can model what sales will be like if schools are closed. 

• What was their average sales per square foot, and what does it need to average to be profitable under current obligations"

NGF: Golf has now been given a “yellow light” to reopen golf courses in all 50 states, which is reflected in our latest forecast of 95% of courses being open for at least some level of play by next week. There are still some local government orders keeping golf closed in metro areas like New York City, Washington D.C. and Chicago. Golf retail, both on- and off-course, is also coming back, trailing course openings but headed in the same direction. And golf consumer anxiety – emotional and financial – is easing."

4/15/20, 12:04 AM;Bearish;1;3;$NKE This couldn't take the 50 day MA which is where a lot of stocks are rallying to and then failing (unless you are TSLA). Dan Nathan from CNBC I think summed it up when he said this is the dumbest rally he's seen in his 25 years. Nike Isn't that far from the all time highs...which is just nuts. It's now more expensive and we are about to have a recession. All the unemployed aren't taking their final dollars and buying Nike. They are paying rent and buying food. When 99% of people are bullish on stocktwits and the cashier at the gas station wants to buy stock then that is my cue to short. Which is what I did EOD. Nike will eventually go to all time highs...but not before it sees 70 or lower first. Even if the Fed decides to buy stocks now...

4/12/20, 07:34 PM;Bearish;1;3;"$NKE Trade Idea

Nike has recovered 44% from the lows 3 weeks ago.  I am watching price action to see if it gets up to $89 where the 1D 100 and 200 EMA's are crossing to the downside (teal and purple lines in screen shot below).  I am looking to short this area as I think it is very likely that Nike does have more downside in the near future.  There is a big gap to fill from 72-77 that is very likely to be filled.  

Short term: Bearish

4/9/20, 07:50 PM;;0;0;$NKE pretty amazing what someone did with This. Took it straight to the middle Bollinger band, which was also the resistance line (blue on the 6 month chart) and the touch the downward facing trend line (red line). All of that at once proved to be the perfect sell point. Now does it reverse back towards $80 to get support or try to break $90 again. I worry about the now 16.5 million people who applied for unemployment and can’t even access their funds. Also, imagine how many people couldn’t get on and even file. In other words, those unemployment numbers are not accurate. I just don’t see stuff getting bought for quite a while, but I love Nike and know it will be back. What do you guys think?

ITEP: 55 publicly traded firms avoided federal income taxes last year, despite reporting nearly $40.5B in combined pre-tax profits. 

Of those 55 companies, 26 paid no federal income taxes for 3  consecutive years—despite having reported profits in each of those years, & a combined $77B in earnings over that 3-year span.

If those 55 companies had paid the statutory 21% corp tax rate on their FY20 profits, their collective tax bill last year would have amounted to $8.5B. Instead, they received a combined $3.5B in tax rebates - resulting in steep negative effective tax rates for some.

Corporate Taxes is a mere 6.6% of total US Federal revenues.

Of the 64% who spent less in FY20, 40% plan to return to 'normal' levels post-pandemic & 27% plan to spend more initially (which bodes well for sales recapture this year).

Some categories can anticipate more of a rebound than others. Masks may have undermined the importance of beauty items, but that & apparel sales are primed to bounce back in the second half of the year.

40% said they'll return to buying makeup & other beauty items and 37% said they'll buy new outfits for going out.

Enthusiasm around athleisure apparel, home goods, & athletic shoes will linger - last year's top 1, 2 & 3 categories respectively. Over 30% said they will be buying in these 3 categories.

3/31/21, 06:36 PM;;0;0;"In the past yr, 64% of Wells Fargo survey respondents spent less during the pandemic, 23% spent the same & 13% spent more. 

""Interestingly, of the 64% who spent less in 2020, nearly 40% plan to return to 'normal' levels post-pandemic & 27% plan to spend more initially (which bodes well for sales recapture this year), while 34% expect to keep their spending depressed,"" 

In their survey, 40% said they'll return to buying makeup & other beauty items and 37% said they'll buy new outfits for going out.

Though they may be returning to the office & otherwise getting out, people don't appear to be finished fixing up their homes & lounging around. Last year's most popular categories were athletic & athleisure apparel (55% of respondents), home (43%) & athletic shoes (35%).

A 3rd of those surveyed said that home will remain a top spending category for them as the pandemic eases, & 31% said they'll be buying athleisure, the top purchased category last year.

McKinsey: Pandemic shifted shift to DTC by 2 years & recommends that in the medium-to-long term, brands that want to thrive will need to aim for over 20% DTC channel.

This week, Nike has notified 7 wholesale accts that they will shut down (DSW, Urban Outfitters, Macy's, Big Five, Olympia ports, Duhnams, & Shoe Show). Nike dropped 9 wholesale accts in August 2020 (Belk, Zappos, City Blue, VIM, EbLens, Dillard's, Fred Meyer, Bob's Stores, & Boscov's). In Nov 2019, Nike stopped selling on Amazon (Nike uses AWS for their website & app).

Nike is on a mission to reduce its presence at undifferentiated wholesale partners & grow DTC to 50% & limit wholesale to only certain ""strategic partners"". 

Oddly (IMHO) Nike also plans to open 150-200 small-footprint Nike Live concept stores."

$RUN swing moving up with good volume in next week's calls. 

$SBUX 110 was reached and now still looking for more upside. 

$NKE 133 needs to break and we will most likely see 134/135.

Our $FB swing is looking very good, touching the target premarket.  Note that it got upgraded this morning. It also announced a partnership with Alphabet for some underwater cables.  If you're still in, you'll notice weekend decay on the premiums already hit them.  Make sure to secure some profit on this one.

3/23/21, 01:40 PM;;0;1;"$NKE 03:25 PM EDT, 03/22/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Nike (NKE) has resolved the supply chain issues that weighed on the sportswear giant's recently released results, according to Oppenheimer & Co.
In a note to clients Monday, Oppenheimer analysts said Nike executives attributed its supply shortfall late last year to a shortage of shipping containers in the Pacific and congested ports on the US West Coast.
The company is now ""caught up,"" on deliveries to wholesale partners and fulfillment centers, Oppenheimer said.
Underlying demand for Nike products in the US and internationally remains robust and is growing as COVID-19 headwinds start to dissipate, according to the note.
Oppenheimer rates Nike's stock outperform with a price target of $137.49.

$SQ - daily MACD crossing over with a lot of momentum expecting this to test $278 this week early next 
$BA - broke below the 9ma on 4hr and seeing some selling off. Playing this short to the $257 area where I’ll watch for a bounce ultimately IMO this pulls back to $243 which was high from December. 
$C - talked about it last night that every time it goes overbought on 4hr it pulls back and tests the 50MA. Expecting the pullback to continue tomorrow to around the $72 level"
