A staffer at Smith College in Massachusetts said she is resigning from her position, saying the college has ‚Äúcreated a racially hostile environment‚Äù while pushing for ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù initiatives.

Jodi Shaw, a white woman who describes herself as a lifelong liberal, said she turned down a settlement from the college so she can instead speak out, according to journalist Bari Weiss. The ‚Äúhostile environment‚Äù was caused, in part, she added, due to so-called ‚Äúanti-racist‚Äù programs in the college that allegedly target white employees.

‚ÄúIn this environment, people‚Äôs worth as human beings, and the degree to which they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, is determined by the color of their skin. It is an environment in which dissenting from the new critical race orthodoxy‚Äî or even failing to swear fealty to it like some kind of McCarthy-era loyalty oath‚Äîis grounds for public humiliation and professional retaliation,‚Äù"

Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coke?

For Coke, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.35%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination indicates that Coke will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate."

2/1/21, 07:50 PM;Bullish;0;0;"$MCD Citi analyst Sergio Matsumoto opened a ""positive Catalyst Watch"" on shares of McDonald's into the February 24 chicken sandwich launch. He also increased his U.S. comp sales during the first half of 2021 to 12% from 6%. The launch occurring in the midst of the lockdown brings an advantage for McDonald's that is underappreciated, Matsumoto tells investors in a research note. The company's high store density of 41 units per million population creates a ""captive audience"" effect because the reduced mobility leads consumers to go to the nearest drive-thru, which oftentimes is McDonald's, says the analyst. He keeps a Buy rating on the shares with a $230 price target.

There were some complications and my daughter is now in the NICU for the next week. Wife is required to stay for the next 5 days. Stocks are a great distraction to keep the mind busy, but unfortunately the weekend is almost upon us and stocks will be dead. Hopefully things turn out well. Due to restrictions, I can only visit 1hr per day. 
 
**This is being posted because some asked for a follow up.** 
 
 I have finally decided on a number of shares I want to get to and lock in (about 4,900 more shares).  
Then start adding some more blue chips ($MSFTT & $KO) stocks for a weekly income off of options ($2-4k). Will keep reinvesting the weekly call option money back into stocks. Until goals are reached. 
Am investing in a few penny stocks as well ( $OPTI & $ABML). 
 
Nonetheless, I am enjoying this ride with all of you."

1/28/21, 04:49 PM;Bullish;1;1;"$KO This is a great example of how a well known company can become overvalued solely based on memeness. Ratio expansion is a very real thing and has been happening over the past decade as more uneducated Shmoes wiggle their way into equities with no regard for actual, tangible value of a company. People buy coke because it's coke, not because the company is growing, producing increasing streams of cash flows, keeping low debt, and is reasonably priced.

You have to look where no one is looking. Be contradictory. Do the work no one else is doing. $GEO is a great example of this, and will become even more so as time goes on (what happens today or tomorrow does not matter). 

Conversely, people will look at a stock like $TR and think they're a genius if they bought at $30 like I did. They're not. These random waves of crazy sentiment are great for a quick gain to redeploy capital cheaply elsewhere, but don't fool yourself into thinking you predicted them. Simply react to them and move on."

There is no insider information. People just talking. Nothing illegal IMO. Even bigger what about our own government saying that the economy is not doing well and sending the market down. Really.

1)Mostly excited about $MNTK it really went under the radar when it IPO'd last Friday.  
2)$KO's earning is coming up in a couple of weeks and I expect a climb back to mid 50's before then.  
3)$MUR took an unexpected slide, but is should recover fairly quick.  I read where a firm shifted a large amount of shares out of MUR and into something else.  This probably helped trigger the algorithms.
4)$MRO - I just got a feeling on this one.  It's laying up against the monthly resistance.  Feeling a pop to $9 soon.  
5)Finally $SVC, if COVID is getting under control then this should soar in the coming months.  It's a good time to get in before everyone else does!"

While we feel management continues to make the right long-term decisions, the near-term appears out of their control. Our downgrade rationale is simple - we feel valuation is near-full and believe upwards EPS revisions are unlikely over the next few quarters as the negative implications of COVID last longer than consensus assumes. PT unchanged at $55. We intend to reassess our positioning as we get more visibility into: 1) the timing/shape of mobility trends; and 2) potential reorganization benefits."""

Dec 17 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co will cut 2,200 jobs globally, including 1,200 in the United States, it said on Thursday, as the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic forces the world's largest soda maker to accelerate its business restructuring. 
 
Coca-Cola said on Thursday it will not disclose the number of employees who have accepted the package. It also did not give details about the timeline for the job cuts. 
 
""The pandemic was not a cause for these changes, but it has been a catalyst for the company to move faster,"" Coca-Cola said in an emailed statement."

Apple,has a market capitalization 4times the size of Berkshire and is raking in $73billion of free cash annually,so it's pretty easy for the iPhone maker to spend more than Berkshire

Buffett and his investment partner Charlie Munger only buy back the stock when they think they're getting a good deal.

Based on the stock's conservative valuation of 20 times free cash flow and the quality of the company's underlying assets,from its $113 billion stake in Apple to its massive insurance business.

Coca-Cola is probably Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs most famous investment ever. Over recent years Coca-Cola stock has lagged the market dramatically, so why does Berkshire still own it?
Here are five reasons why:
1. Huge dividends (50% yield on cost)
2. Capital Gains Tax
3. Liquidity issues
4. No better opportunities 
5. He loves to own coke!

17 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for The Coca-Cola in the last 12 months. Their average twelve-month price target is $53.35, predicting that the stock has a possible downside of 1.23%. The high price target for KO is $65.00 and the low price target for KO is $44.00. There are currently 3 hold ratings, 13 buy ratings and 1 strong buy rating for the stock, resulting in a consensus rating of ""Buy.""

Many people might not be aware but these guys own not just the iconic smuckers brand (which I personally love and is still one of the most delicious/affordable fruit spreads to this day), but also Folger's coffee, Dunkin Donuts, Jif Peanut Butter, and the Milk Bone/Nature's recipe/Meow Mix pet food brands. These are all amazing, affordable, non-cyclical staple brands in the CPG space that I am super excited to own and be a part of.

They're actually still a pretty deep value right now, for a company of their size and stature, and really just so often ignored when it comes to non-cyclical CPG dividend payers. The reason is they're not seen as a champion/aristocrat, since they've ""only"" spit off 20 years of aggressive dividend growth so far."

10/30/20, 04:55 PM;Bullish;2;4;$SRNE it's just paper losses, if you panic on these drops or this big drop the last couple of weeks and the story hasn't changed for the worse, then just don't look at it for a few weeks. Investing is not whining everyday when a stock goes down and not cheering when it goes up.. The long term outlook is important here and that one is still solid. And if you cannot handle it ---> sell, don't buy and go put your money in stocks with a  low Beta, way under 1 like, $KO or $T, nothing really happens there but at least you can sleep better.

In my opinion the evidence is clear, people will say they were a great contributor to the current global obesity crisis and  the mounting pollution littering our ecosystems. As financier shouldn‚Äôt this be of a concern to you now? Who will end up paying for the mess that these companies make? The governments of the world of course and what will they do if and when they wake up to their corporate malfeasance. They will make them pay. If and when these companys‚Äô business model becomes sustainable is the real question you should be asking yourself before you make an investment.

10/24/20, 01:25 AM;;3;5;"@everyone This week in review, and my lessons for this week. I worked hard to clearly think of the game plan for each of the earnings and what to play for this week but like any other trader I diverted from it. I need to be more disciplined as well to follow the game plan. 

I wrote this on last Sunday. pineapplestocks.com/post/ea...

Here were the plays:
$NFLX $460P Dec Naked Put | Stock is at $488, and those puts would of been safe
$TSLA Vertical $450/$455C weekly | Stock is at $420, and this would of paid out 100% premium 
$SNAP Strangle, would of paid out around 1000%. 
$IBM Iron Condor $136/$116, it closed at $116, this would of paid out.
$KO Short Strangle, $52C Sell / $48P Sell, it closed at $50, this would of paid out 100% premium.

All of the plays if we only played 5 stocks this week would of been all winners. Next week, I‚Äôm sticking to this game plan, even if it means we aren‚Äôt entering that many trades. I cannot divert from this."

JWN- has been shorted hard since last month but Im liking the potential for a breakout. It is trying to break the descending wedge for a breakout. Possibly to $14 range again. Has 44 percent short on the float and looking to squeeze if the earnings are better than expected. The sales from last er should be priced in this time. I can see this trying to squeeze back up and possibly to 20 like it should have been. Short term to midterm pt 16-17.

KO- Great earnings for coke cola and it appears to be trading in the ascending wedge pattern. I see going to break out of the wedge soon for a huge run up in a few months. Strong support at $50 and been trading around this range. A break out around $51 I can see $55 in a few months. I like this as a long term play. January calls seem the most logical from now. $55 calls at most I would say for a naked call. If this falls below 49 then I would recommend an exit."

Here is a summary. $KO already had announced a discontinuation of many brands, but just officially announced it would be cancelling 200+ brands. Here is a quote from the article: 

""Many of the brands Coke will shut down are only sold in certain markets instead of nationwide, he said.
There's a stark difference between Coca-Cola's successful brands and its struggling ones, Quincey said over the summer. He explained that the underperforming beverages have ""little to no scale,"" and that their sales represent only 2% of total revenue.
Culling the brands is one of a number of strategies the company laid out this summer to help it grow. Coke says the move will free up resources to invest in higher-growth drinks.""

It doesn't specifically mention $CELH as a higher growth drink, but please fine me another one that would currently fit the category better than $CELH."

After that, if it happens, will be milestones in licensing, manufacture, orders, distribution, marketshare.

Then there's the same thing in chewing tobacco (one possible 3rd arm), or licensing cocaine-free coca to $KO to save the denaturing production costs. Controlling alkaloid levels, if it leads to license-fees, has a lot of potential. Some company is going to harness that well enough that they start to gobble up successful competitors.

One distributor summed it up best: ""TAP has done more in the last 6 months than they have in the last 3 years."" 

May take a few months to see reversal  in chart, but  the optimism reminds me of $SAM turn in July 2017.

Guggenheim named them as ""best idea"" and has a price target of $62 on the stock. The analyst thinks seltzer, including Topo Chico, and Yuengling will add 3-4% top-line growth. He expects the board to reinstate the dividend starting 2Q next year with a path to deleveraging below 3x by mid-2021.

Morningstar gives $TAP a fair market value of $55."

Let's say CELSIUS is not as healthy as they claim, even though they've already prevailed in a class action lawsuit that was brought to them at the same time as $KO was dealing with the lawsuit of their Enviga. Well, guess what, Celsius is indisputably more healthy than Red Bull and Monster which is the main point. It's not close, since Red Bull and Monster don't even attempt to claim it being okay for you. People wouldn't drink it if it didn't help them, and whether it helps or not is obvious because it's directly tied to your personal performance, whether working out, or simply sitting in your office. People wouldn't buy it if it didn't work. Yep, the stock may have run up too fast, as has EVERY stock in the entire $SPY , $DJIA , and $NASDAQ .

That threat is the Mexican government‚Äôs junk food label law. Passed in October 2019 and scheduled to come into effect on October 1 this year, the law requires all food packages with contents high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat to carry clear health warnings on the front.

A similar labeling law was passed in Chile in 2016. The new legislation included the world‚Äôs strictest limits on how and where food companies can advertise junk food to children. It worked like a dream ‚Äî and was a nightmare for the companies affected: Over the next two years, sugary drink sales plunged by 23%.

So successful was the experiment that almost a dozen countries, including Mexico, are interested in replicating it."

Oct 1 is the Date

The New Threat on the Horizon.

But for the Coca-Cola Company, and for the bottlers, fast approaching on the horizon is a threat that could exact a significant long-term toll on sales in Mexico.

Passed in October 2019 and scheduled to come into effect on October 1 this year, the law requires all food packages with contents high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat to carry clear health warnings on the front.

A similar labeling law was passed in Chile in 2016. The new legislation included the world‚Äôs strictest limits on how and where food companies can advertise junk food to children

Over the next two years, sugary drink sales plunged by 23%.

So successful was the experiment that almost a dozen countries, including Mexico, are interested in replicating it."

It has been decades since Coke sold booze in the US. The company previously owned a wine business that it sold in 1983. In 2018, Coke introduced a fizzy, lemon-flavored alcoholic drink in Japan called Lemon-Do.

Bump Williams Consulting: Americans spent $3B on hard seltzer in US retail stores in the 52 weeks ended July 11, up 241% from a year earlier.

The market is dominated by White Claw, owned by Mike's Hard Lemonade Co. $SAM makes Truly, the No. 2 brand. $BUD & other big brewers have also introduced hard seltzer brands, including Bud Light Seltzer and Corona Hard Seltzer.

The New Threat on the Horizon.

But for the Coca-Cola Company, and for the bottlers, fast approaching on the horizon is a threat that could exact a significant long-term toll on sales in Mexico.

Passed in October 2019 and scheduled to come into effect on October 1 this year, the law requires all food packages with contents high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat to carry clear health warnings on the front.

A similar labeling law was passed in Chile in 2016. The new legislation included the world‚Äôs strictest limits on how and where food companies can advertise junk food to children

Over the next two years, sugary drink sales plunged by 23%.

So successful was the experiment that almost a dozen countries, including Mexico, are interested in replicating it."

I believe both parties have moved on when Monster lost the arbitration ruling about Coke Energy but business wise Rodney and Hilton probably raised eyebrows when they found out a new competitor. I think getting involved in alcoholic drinks with another distributor would be great in the future for shareholders if Rodney and Hilton want to sell the company. I said it back then when it was announced but Coke's decision of entering the energy category was a fuck you to Monster. Yes Monster lost the arbitration but that loss might be a win in the future if you have another bidder wanting them.
7/28/20, 04:36 AM;;0;2;If and when Monster decides to get in the alcoholic drink the obvious choice for distribution would be $BUD AB-Inbev. It's also a nice hedge should Rodney and Hilton should want to sell the company or make the recommendation of selling. It appears $KO hasn't made eyes about purchasing the rest of this company since they announced their agreement back in 2015. Monster before going to Coke had the majority of it's distribution done by A/B BUD. Finally as much they said it would affect there relationship when Monster and Coke with a arbitrator ruling in favor of the latter when it came to making Coke Energy.  I said it at the time it was terrible mistake by the CEO to get into Energy. I do believe they've moved on but if Monster were to hook up with BUD again that should make all shareholders very happy.

7/22/20, 12:01 PM
Coca-Cola stock is rising early Wednesday, a day after releasing better- than-expected earnings. The reason: an upgrade from Morgan Stanley, which argues that the shares have gotten too cheap.

Analyst Dara Mohsenian boosted his rating on Coca-Cola (ticker: KO) shares to Overweight from Equal Weight, and added $2 to his price target, taking it to $54. The move comes as the ""stock's recent underperformance and outsize valuation discount versus peers has become too pronounced in our minds."" Shares of Coca-Cola have dropped 13% this year, lagging PepsiCo (PEP), which has declined just 1.4%, the S&P 500, which has risen 1%, and even the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is off 5.7%."

...Is the stock a buy now? However, the probably more interesting question is whether the stock could be a buy. In any case, the dividend seems sustainable and with a current share price of $ 47.50 (July 21, 2020, which is the basis for all prices), the total dividend of $ 1.64 per year would correspond to a dividend yield of 3.45%. For a royal dividend, this is guaranteed to be anything but wrong.

7/21/20, 06:36 PM;Bullish;0;2;"$KO Coca-Cola exceeds most expectations 

The consensus assumed that earnings per share would be 40 cents (range: 33 to 44 cents). 

However, Coca-Cola managed to surpass this forecast by 42 cents. Nevertheless, the coronavirus pandemic has had a significant impact on performance. This should come as no surprise given the closed restaurants and bars during the global lockdown. Revenue decreased 28% year-over-year to $ 7.175 billion (expected: $ 7.238 billion). Organic sales fell 26% year-over-year (estimate: -21.6%), while operating cash flow was $ 2.8 billion since the beginning of the year, a decrease of 38%. The company said the full year results could not be reasonably estimated. 

However, management sees the 2nd quarter as the most affected quarter of the year and ensures that the balance sheet remains strong. Since most expectations (apart from second quarter earnings) were exceeded, Coca-Cola stock rose more than 2% in pre-market trading today.

If the company were to focus excessively on cost-cutting at the expense of growth potential, he said, ""we will do well for a year or two, but then the wheels will come off.""

While Coca-Cola typically trades at a premium to rival PepsiCo, the two are now valued equivalently, though not cheaply, at around 24 times forward earnings. At the moment, that price doesn't look tempting for either, but particularly not for Coca-Cola. Best to let this one settle before opening."

The beverage company Coca-Cola (ISIN: US1912161007, NYSE: KO) will pay a quarterly dividend of 41 US cents per share to its shareholders on October 1, 2020 (record date is September 15, 2020), as reported on Thursday.

 The world's largest soft drink manufacturer pays $ 1.64 to investors every year. At the current price level of $ 46.15 (as of July 16, 2020), this corresponds to a current dividend yield of 3.55 percent. Coca-Cola increased the dividend payout in February 2020 by 2.5 percent to the current amount. The company announced the 58th annual dividend increase in a row. Shareholders have received a dividend since 1920.

Hi traders:

KO is looking very good for mid/long term buy.

We see the price had a massive dropped from Covid, and strong bullish impulse up, forming a larger correction.

When we dropped down to lower time frame, we see a potential rejection off the bottom of the structure,

and forming a continuation correction.

I will wait for confirmation of a completion of the structure, and look for buy setups.

In addition to the classic cola, which is also available in the cherry or vanilla varieties, for example, the company also has other soft drinks such as Fanta, Sprite, the iced fuzetea brand, the Wasser Vio or the sports drink Powerade. According to ""Mirror"":

 As most of the economic impact of the crisis started being felt in March, Coca-Cola‚Äôs Q1 was largely shielded. But we believe Coca-Cola‚Äôs Q2 results in July will confirm the hit to its revenue, with the management having already warned that the next few quarters will be difficult, unlike Q1 2020. The company is also likely to lower its full-year 2020 guidance with its Q2 announcement.
Specifically, we believe the full-year revenue expectations formed by the market may be closer to $28 billion about 25% lower than its 2019 revenue of $37.3 billion, and 12% lower than the 2018 revenue of $32 billion."

Earnings -July

The market isn‚Äôt going to stomach this well.

Coca-Cola‚Äôs Q2 results in July will confirm the hit to its revenue, with the management having already warned that the next few quarters will be difficult, unlike Q1 2020. The company is also likely to lower its full-year 2020 guidance with its Q2 announcement.
Specifically, we believe the full-year revenue expectations formed by the market may be closer to $28 billion about 25% lower than its 2019 revenue of $37.3 billion, and 12% lower than the 2018 revenue of $32 billion."

The market isn‚Äôt going to stomach this well.

Coca-Cola‚Äôs Q2 results in July will confirm the hit to its revenue, with the management having already warned that the next few quarters will be difficult, unlike Q1 2020. The company is also likely to lower its full-year 2020 guidance with its Q2 announcement.
Specifically, we believe the full-year revenue expectations formed by the market may be closer to $28 billion about 25% lower than its 2019 revenue of $37.3 billion, and 12% lower than the 2018 revenue of $32 billion."

Unfortunately one of the smarter value investors I've seen says KO is not a buy. 

His rationale is that Coke is borrowing to continue the dividend, while their top line revenue is shrinking. EBITDA has remained stagnant and debt levels of 4x EBITDA are not great. 

Dividend seems to be the only saving grace here, I will sell covered calls for a number of weeks to exit this position at break even at least."

AT&T chart looking very similar to the Coke chart.  Almost made its way up to the 1D 200 where price action has sold down pretty fast.   Price Action started today on the 1D 55 and 21 (green and yellow lines) and has sold down since then.   With the 1D RSI and stochastic's crossing down and in a bearish posture I am thinking this continues lower to the $28-$29 area.

6/9/20, 03:34 AM;Bullish;0;2;"$KO idk if folks that follow me are tracking coke, but honestly this thing is hot and ready to go to hit a nice gap fill once it breaks 50. With the way the market is going Id expect KO to be above 55 before end of the month and filling the gap. Check out the charts. Technical indicators looking good. Rsi a bit high and hot but macd crossover on the ytd chart, golden cross, and in general big gaps to fill with Ko underperforming in recovery as opposed to pep and others 

Markets roaring and we‚Äôre right at resistance with KO for 50, if we break that and the 200 ma were straight vertical to fill gaps up to 55 imo. 

Shares are one angle, debit call spreads another, and calls are another that‚Äôs a nice possible win (can be gambler either June 55, or July and September 55 which imo look more appealing with time horizon to set new all time high) 

September 60 is nice too, I plan to flip it later and turn my 55C into debit call spreads that are basically house money."
