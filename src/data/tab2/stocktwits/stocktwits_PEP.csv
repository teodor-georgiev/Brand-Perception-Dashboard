12/9/20, 10:59 PM;;0;3;$PEP $FB $UVXY $VZ $WMT I can't create confidence out of thin air. One has to be dedicated to a long-term disciplined strategy to enjoy repeatable profit potential in the equity markets. You have to make a decision. The go-it-alone strategy is not generally where the greatest potential is for an investor. An investor is best advantaged with resources, support, a team around him/her. We traded the market, bought the dip according to our game plan and had several profitable trades on the day by engaging our game plan, knowing with a degree of probability how the long-term outlook will take shape. StockTwits can overwhelm many participants understanding about what truly works and what is fashionable and/or popular. Know that this isn't where alpha is generally developed. Have a good evening, and hopefully the message was delivered as intended, for the betterment of the individual investor.

I may take a cheap $145 call and $146 call. If the price decides to dip again below 143-143.50s I would average down one more time. Only small amounts of calls this is a lotto play. If this bounces today into to the 146+ I am hoping. Depending on the opening I would either do step 1 or 2. Price action matters of course if it drops a lot from open ill take 144 and 145 calls instead.

Many people might not be aware but these guys own not just the iconic smuckers brand (which I personally love and is still one of the most delicious/affordable fruit spreads to this day), but also Folger's coffee, Dunkin Donuts, Jif Peanut Butter, and the Milk Bone/Nature's recipe/Meow Mix pet food brands. These are all amazing, affordable, non-cyclical staple brands in the CPG space that I am super excited to own and be a part of.

They're actually still a pretty deep value right now, for a company of their size and stature, and really just so often ignored when it comes to non-cyclical CPG dividend payers. The reason is they're not seen as a champion/aristocrat, since they've ""only"" spit off 20 years of aggressive dividend growth so far."

PEP- Trending nicely along the double sma support and upward wedge. This will see 143 within 1-2 month. Strong support around 136 and if I were to play a debit spread personally 136 to 140. Bull put spread would be the same. PEP could test 140 upper trendline resistance this week or consolidate around 136-139 for this week. 
PINS- exploding off the last weeks 41 bottom call to 45+ I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see this near 50 end of the week . Realistically must touch 46 then 48. Safety play would be 41 -43 debit spread or a bull put from 41-44. I think this is a generally safe play by end of the week with good volume.

ZM- most likely will test 500$ this week as it confirmed a good support around 480. If you are looking to play this best to debit spread around huge support 480. 

WMT- look for a potential entry around 139-140. Long term 150+ but short term it needs consolidate a bit. November or later debit spreads I would recommend just incase of a pull back."

I took 1500 off the table about $24.36 -- but bought back 400 @ the same price thinking it would rise into the close, I also added 450 $SDOW at $18.04  & 20 $PEP below $138 & some $UGL  --  but Monday is murky, stim talk back & forth keeps hope alive.

10/2/20, 03:25 PM;;0;1;"$WMT $PYPL $PEP 

PEP- good level of consolidation between 137-139 range. It has strong support at 135 for a possible downside. With the trend looking positive midterm, expect this to test 143 then 145 in a few weeks or maybe sooner. However 140 has to break and consolidate to make this happen..

PYPL ‚Äì Tested the lower gap fill on the sma support. It has strong support around 190 so I can see this in the path of the mid term swing to 200 then 205 then new all time high in a few weeks. As this resets I cant imagine why this cant see above 200 in two weeks as a temporarily support. Short term swing play medium risk and medium reward. Long term ‚Äì medium risk and high return. 

WMT- still in a good range to buy if it doesn‚Äôt fall below 139. I think a good dip buy is around low 140s and mid 139s. If it went to low 139s look for a potential bounce entry. However, the long run I see Walmart 150+ by December. Walmart has been impressive so far."

NVDA- still a strong bullish movement could hit a new all time high and even break to 620. Was a chart play call in the discord from last week at 480$ huge gainer here. 

PEP- good earnings and possibly fill the gap for a long-term position near the 143-147 range. Have to consolidate and burn the options for a little bit in the morning but has strong support. A good long-term play 

PINS- looks good for a potential gap up to 43-44. Could drop around low 41s for an entry but I see upward continuation for the short term. 
PYPL ‚Äì Looking to breakout pass the 200 mark and test the gap fill to 205-208 mark first. Watch out for paypal to explode this week or next. This was a call from yesterday from 193 range. Possible dip play around 195-196 maybe. 
SBUX- nice chart set up around the sma. Could test the 88-90$ soon actually. Can be a good short term swing. Anything below 85 I wouldn‚Äôt swing calls honestly."

1 - Technically, the stock appears to have been mostly range bound the last 6 months. It's trading above its 21, 50 and 200 DMAs, but not by a lot

2 - Fundamentally, I like the company. It's a defensive stock in that they sell ""necessities"" with inelastic demand and pay a nice 2.95% dividend

$UNFI had a nice report yesterday, was hoping for 7B in sales as I thought that could have been a catalyst for move up. The beat was good enough to keep its already significant annual gains.

But how about 25-35%% gains in 2-3 weeks?  I think so. That is my play. If I am patient, I think it will pay off, despite the short-term pain.  Or... I could lose a bunch & this could wind up at $20 again on stim news, but I keep coming back to the election that WILL NOT BE Pretty.  So, for now, I will suffer through FOMO -- Fear Of Missing Out of a stim pop (which is now mostly already priced in) which I think is the biggest reason the market is popping up, adding to Friday's froth.   For those who are nimble enough, to catch some gains in that, great!  Sincerely Happy for you. I am also holding some bull plays I think are less frothy: $JNUG, $WRTC, & $PEP for some gains this week.  GL!

Yes we‚Äôd all like it to rocket to $30-$50 with this I‚Äôm in no hurry. I‚Äôll collect my dividend and drip it back into the company. I have my plays for huge returns and have this for steady returns. I think of this like $PEP $KO great companies with room for growth. None will rocket $10-$20 in a day but great long term plays. $UTZ just started trading under the new ticker a few weeks ago. If you want huge returns right now go play EV or alternative energy.

8/17/20, 06:47 PM;;0;2;$PEP Daily timeframe. Long-term lateralization for Pepsi here is about to test its key static resistance at 139 level after moving in the range between 127 and 138 since early April. Currently holding over its MA20, if it manages to break over 139 it'll head towards 143 first and a new all-time high over 147 after that based on the width of the current range in which the stock is lateralizing. If it fails to break over 139 in the immediate term, it's key for the stock to hold over 134.8, static support below. Otherwise, a deeper correction towards the base of the channel will be the next step, being that level at 127.

Hello traders:

Looking at PEP for more upside potential.

We see the price has made a sharp move down from the Covid, and quickly had a reversal bullish impulse up.

Price begin to form this larger structure, good signs for continuation.

Latest price action see a breakout from this structure and forming lower time frame correction.

I would like to see how the price develop here in the up coming days in the NY sessions to look for the buy.

Thank you"

Consolidating the recovery move off of March low last four months in a tight horizontal range. Got really tight the last few weeks. $139 key area. Great risk/reward opportunity to participate in the next up leg.

           The problem going forward for many traders:  
  
- You'll continue to let a narrative guide your market exposure   
   (bullish vs. bearish and overall allocation  
- In bull markets, there is always consolidation.  
- The average year will express 3.3, 5% pull backs.   
- You'll think a consolidation period is something more, simply   
   because of point #1.   
- You won't follow price, trend, breadth and markets' historic   
   data in favor of some narrative that validates your personal   
   bias.   
- You won't be able to rationalize that the greatest market   
   returns occur when earnings are at their worst levels, because  
   you've avoided the historic data.  
- When consolidation is found, you won't course correct and   
   align with the longer-term trend and allow future gains to go  
   unrealized.   
  
P.S. This was firstly issued in 2015. Study history folks, study your

- UTZ is a 100 year old family owned company.  
 
- Recession proof. 
 
- Increased sales due to COVID (see $PEP earnings) 
 
- Will provide dividends upon merger 
 
- The merger will eliminate 3/4ths of existing debt 
 
- Added experience from CCH board. Antonio Fernandez served as Vice President and Chief supply officer of Pinnacle Foods. Vice President at Kraft. Chief Supply Chain Officer at Cadbury. 
 
- Official snack of the MLB (think of the possible PR) 
 
- Investor presentation states their focused on acquisitions + expanding market share, dividends and share buy backs. 
 
- UTZ family remains the majority owners so they have a vested interesting in seeing the SP raise. 
 
- Warren Buffet tried buying UTZ back in 2015.

Hi traders:

PEP also falls on my mid/long term watch for equities buy.

We see price dropped sharply from mid February, and strong bull impulse up.

Price then begin to form a larger continuation correction structure, giving us a good potential opportunities for more buy.

Currently this structure is not complete yet, I would wait for price to tag the bottom of the structure and observe for reversal indication,

or price breaks out of this large correction and in this case I will wait for smaller continuation correction to go long.

3/11/20, 09:28 PM;;1;2;"Raw-sugar futures tumbled 20% to $0.12lb since reaching their highest level in more than two years on Feb. 12. The drop has caught out traders who had expected prices to keep rising due to adverse weather for farmers in India and Thailand, two of the world's largest producers of the sweetener.

Monday's rout in oil prices‚Äîthe biggest since the Persian Gulf War in 1991‚Äîadded to existing pressure on sugar, which is sensitive to swings in the energy market . And the spreading coronavirus is expected to weigh on demand for soft drinks and other sugary products.

Sugar mills in Brazil are mostly able to convert sugar cane into either sugar or ethanol, a biofuel widely used to power cars in the Latin American country. When energy prices decline, it incentivizes mills to produce more sugar and less ethanol, lifting global supplies of the sweetener.

2/27/20, 09:37 PM;;3;0;$PEP this stock is supposed to help me during bad times. Why is this almost 10 bucks off its high?
2/27/20, 12:21 PM;;2;4;"$SPY at some point this will consolidate, and trap a bunch of bag holders in the process...  

Look for a pullback (down) to about 23% of the original high.  If it pushes through that without much effort, a drop (from ATH) of about 38% should present some good support... 

However...  if the bounce off either of these supportive areas doesn't hold, we're looking at the beginning of a two year drop (guesstimate) in the overall value of equities.  

Historically, when a bear market presents like this (if this is what happens), money tends to rotate into: Financials, ENERGY, and Consumer Staples (think $PEP, $KHC , etc..).  Biopharma (like $MRNA , etc..) also gives volatility traders some pretty good options.  

GL everyone...  Remember, a healthy pullback is a good thing for bulls, not a bad thing.  When an asset veers from linear (y=mx+b) to parabolic (x^2), it ALWAYS pulls back; then question isn't ""if,"" rather ""when?""

The snack and beverage giant said Thursday it will meet or exceed its full-year revenue growth after sales and profit both topped Wall Street estimates for last quarter. The results showed that once again consumers were willing to pay more for its products. ‚ÄúThe consumer right now in the U.S., at least in terms of our business, is doing really well,‚Äù Hugh Johnston, the company‚Äôs chief financial officer, said in an interview."

Applying current market consensus rates implies a 2-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to both reported net revenue and EPS performance. This assumption and the guidance above implies 2019 core earnings per share of $5.50, a 3 percent decrease compared to 2018 core earnings per share of $5.66.

PepsiCo sees FY2019 EPS of $5.50, versus the consensus of $5.52.
The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and markto-market impacts. The Company now expects to meet or exceed its full-year organic revenue growth target of 4 percent. Consistent with its previous guidance for 2019, the Company continues to expect: ‚Ä¢ A core effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent. ‚Ä¢ A decline in core constant currency EPS of approximately 1 percent, which incorporates lapping a number of 2018 strategic asset-sale and refranchising gains, the expected increased core effective tax rate, and expected 2019 incremental investments to strengthen the business. ‚Ä¢"

9/23/19, 03:25 AM;;0;1;"$PEP Lay‚Äôs has a 75.9% US market share. Globally, potato chips are a $29B industry & it‚Äôs expected to hit $35B in 5 years.

Which is to say that even a famous bag of chips like Lay‚Äôs needs to stand out to stay relevant. And that marketing maxim probably explains why the design team at Lay‚Äôs has spent the past 2 years working on a new design for its potato chip bags.

Why should it take 2 years to redo a chip bag? Frito-Lay sells over 25 flavors & has variants‚Äîreduced fat, less sodium‚Äîfor each. What‚Äôs more, the range of flavors is broad, from its Classic salted chips to something called Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup. And each flavor boasts a set of existing fans with their own familiarities and expectations. So when it comes to engineering a new design language that will work across the entire line."
9/22/19, 11:39 PM;Bullish;0;2;Get nothing twisted! I'm still long $KO though my position has dipped. I have my targets and am expecting a bounce and to be around 55-56 by Friday. Personally I think coupled with the fact that Coca-Cola spends the largest in terms of marketing by a marginal amount we might see substantial growth in the Costa Coffee business however won't know for certain until the next ER which is Oct 18th, 2019. HOWEVER if any bad China/Trump/Iran news comes out there is a good chance it falls relatively hard (along with all market) but I like KO's beta of 0.4 for some slight market deviation neutrality. $SPY $DJIA $BABA $PEP
