## Brand perception dashboard
As part of my master's thesis, I created an interactive web-based dashboard using Dash and Plotly. The primary purpose of the dashboard was to display how consumers perceive different brands.

The first section visualizes the findings from the research paper ["Mining Brand Perceptions from Twitter Social Networks"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2015.0968) -published in Marketing Science, written by Aron Culotta and Jennifer Cutler.

The second section displays the impact of brand perceptions on the stock market for five well-known brands, including Apple, Coca-Cola, H&M, Nike, and Starbucks. The data used for the visualization was obtained from the social networks Twitter and StockTwits, as well as the marketing research company YouGov.
